Oxfam said UK plans to resettle 20,000 Syrians by 2020 were \"not good enough\", but Britain says it is also focused on providing aid to people in the region. The UK's pledge of \u00c2\u00a32.3bn to help people affected by the humanitarian crisis caused by the civil war in Syria makes it the second largest bilateral donor in the world after the US. Oxfam says while Britain has been generous in providing financial aid for those displaced by Syria's civil war, it \"can and should do more\". It argues that countries with strong economies and developed infrastructures need to shoulder a greater responsibility towards refugees than nations such as Lebanon and Jordan, where thousands of Syrians are now based.

The International Rescue Committee (IRC) made the plea as the Syrian conflict enters its sixth year, with no end in sight. The IRC is urging governments around the world to step up their efforts to provide safe haven to those fleeing the war-torn country. Currently, only a fraction of the displaced Syrians have been resettled, with many languishing in refugee camps or struggling to survive in makeshift settlements. The IRC argues that resettlement is a crucial step in providing a durable solution to the crisis, allowing refugees to rebuild their lives and contribute to their new host countries. The charity is calling on governments to increase their resettlement quotas and to provide more resources to support the resettlement process. With the Syrian crisis showing no signs of abating, the IRC's plea is a timely reminder of the need for urgent action to address the humanitarian crisis."}, {"human": "The last print edition will be on 31 December, reflecting the trend for newspapers and magazines to move online as traditional advertising declines.

By opening up the job market to more foreign workers, the NHS hopes to plug the gaps and improve patient care.
