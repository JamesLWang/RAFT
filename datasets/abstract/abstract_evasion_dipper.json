We study these questions from the\nperspective of group theory, thereby opening a new approach towards a theory of\nDeep learning.\n  One factor behind the recent resurgence of the subject is a key algorithmic\nstep called {\\em pretraining}: first search for a good generative model for the\ninput samples, and repeat the process one layer at a time. We show deeper\nimplications of this simple principle, by establishing a connection with the\ninterplay of orbits and stabilizers of group actions. Although the neural\nnetworks themselves may not form groups, we show the existence of {\\em shadow}\ngroups whose elements serve as close approximations.\n  Over the shadow groups, the pre-training step, originally introduced as a\nmechanism to better initialize a network, becomes equivalent to a search for\nfeatures with minimal orbits. Intuitively, these features are in a way the {\\em\nsimplest}. Which explains why a deep learning network learns simple features\nfirst.

We\noptimize sets of filters so as to minimize the nuclear norms of matrices of\ntheir local activations (i.e., the sum of the singular values), thus\nencouraging a flexible form of sparsity that is not tied to any particular\ndictionary or coordinate system. Filters optimized according to this objective\nare oriented and bandpass, and their responses exhibit substantial local\ncorrelation. We show that images can be reconstructed nearly perfectly from\nestimates of the local filter response covariances alone, and with minimal\ndegradation (either visual or MSE) from low-rank approximations of these\ncovariances. As such, this representation holds much promise for use in\napplications such as denoising, compression, and texture representation, and\nmay form a useful substrate for hierarchical decompositions.", "Most modern convolutional neural networks (CNNs) used for object recognition\nare built using the same principles: Alternating convolution and max-pooling\nlayers followed by a small number of fully connected layers. We re-evaluate the\nstate of the art for object recognition from small images with convolutional\nnetworks, questioning the necessity of different components in the pipeline. We\nfind that max-pooling can simply be replaced by a convolutional layer with\nincreased stride without loss in accuracy on several image recognition\nbenchmarks. Following this finding -- and building on other recent work for\nfinding simple network structures -- we propose a new architecture that\nconsists solely of convolutional layers and yields competitive or state of the\nart performance on several object recognition datasets (CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100,\nImageNet).

In regular autoencoders, detailed information needs to be\ncarried through the highest layers but lateral connections from encoder to\ndecoder relieve this pressure. It is shown that abstract invariant features can\nbe translated to detailed reconstructions when invariant features are allowed\nto modulate the strength of the lateral connection. Three dAE structures with\nmodulated and additive lateral connections, and without lateral connections\nwere compared in experiments using real-world images. The experiments verify\nthat adding modulated lateral connections to the model 1) improves the accuracy\nof the probability model for inputs, as measured by denoising performance; 2)\nresults in representations whose degree of invariance grows faster towards the\nhigher layers; and 3) supports the formation of diverse invariant poolings.", "We develop a new method for visualizing and refining the invariances of\nlearned representations. Specifically, we test for a general form of\ninvariance, linearization, in which the action of a transformation is confined\nto a low-dimensional subspace. Given two reference images (typically, differing\nby some transformation), we synthesize a sequence of images lying on a path\nbetween them that is of minimal length in the space of the representation (a\n\"representational geodesic\"). If the transformation relating the two reference\nimages is linearized by the representation, this sequence should follow the\ngradual evolution of this transformation. We use this method to assess the\ninvariance properties of a state-of-the-art image classification network and\nfind that geodesics generated for image pairs differing by translation,\nrotation, and dilation do not evolve according to their associated\ntransformations. Our method also suggests a remedy for these failures, and\nfollowing this prescription, we show that the modified representation is able\nto linearize a variety of geometric image transformations.", "Genomics are rapidly transforming medical practice and basic biomedical\nresearch, providing insights into disease mechanisms and improving therapeutic\nstrategies, particularly in cancer.

The data are linearly transformed, and\neach component is then normalized by a pooled activity measure, computed by\nexponentiating a weighted sum of rectified and exponentiated components and a\nconstant. We optimize the parameters of the full transformation (linear\ntransform, exponents, weights, constant) over a database of natural images,\ndirectly minimizing the negentropy of the responses. The optimized\ntransformation substantially Gaussianizes the data, achieving a significantly\nsmaller mutual information between transformed components than alternative\nmethods including ICA and radial Gaussianization. The transformation is\ndifferentiable and can be efficiently inverted, and thus induces a density\nmodel on images. We show that samples of this model are visually similar to\nsamples of natural image patches.

A\ncompletely satisfactory explanation for their success remains elusive. Here, we\npresent a novel explanation for the benefits of skip connections in training\nvery deep networks. The difficulty of training deep networks is partly due to\nthe singularities caused by the non-identifiability of the model. Several such\nsingularities have been identified in previous works: (i) overlap singularities\ncaused by the permutation symmetry of nodes in a given layer, (ii) elimination\nsingularities corresponding to the elimination, i.e. consistent deactivation,\nof nodes, (iii) singularities generated by the linear dependence of the nodes.\nThese singularities cause degenerate manifolds in the loss landscape that slow\ndown learning. We argue that skip connections eliminate these singularities by\nbreaking the permutation symmetry of nodes, by reducing the possibility of node\nelimination and by making the nodes less linearly dependent. Moreover, for\ntypical initializations, skip connections move the network away from the\n\"ghosts\" of these singularities and sculpt the landscape around them to\nalleviate the learning slow-down.

We experimentally show that our model achieves state-of-the-art\nclassification results on several standard molecular datasets. Finally, we\nperform a qualitative analysis and give some insights on whether the node\nprediction helps the model better classify graphs.", "Neural network pruning techniques can reduce the parameter counts of trained\nnetworks by over 90%, decreasing storage requirements and improving\ncomputational performance of inference without compromising accuracy. However,\ncontemporary experience is that the sparse architectures produced by pruning\nare difficult to train from the start, which would similarly improve training\nperformance.\n  We find that a standard pruning technique naturally uncovers subnetworks\nwhose initializations made them capable of training effectively. Based on these\nresults, we articulate the \"lottery ticket hypothesis:\" dense,\nrandomly-initialized, feed-forward networks contain subnetworks (\"winning\ntickets\") that - when trained in isolation - reach test accuracy comparable to\nthe original network in a similar number of iterations. The winning tickets we\nfind have won the initialization lottery: their connections have initial\nweights that make training particularly effective.\n  We present an algorithm to identify winning tickets and a series of\nexperiments that support the lottery ticket hypothesis and the importance of\nthese fortuitous initializations. We consistently find winning tickets that are\nless than 10-20% of the size of several fully-connected and convolutional\nfeed-forward architectures for MNIST and CIFAR10. Above this size, the winning\ntickets that we find learn faster than the original network and reach higher\ntest accuracy.", "Generative adversarial networks (GANs) form a generative modeling approach\nknown for producing appealing samples, but they are notably difficult to train.\nOne common way to tackle this issue has been to propose new formulations of the\nGAN objective. Yet, surprisingly few studies have looked at optimization\nmethods designed for this adversarial training. In this work, we cast GAN\noptimization problems in the general variational inequality framework. Tapping\ninto the mathematical programming literature, we counter some common\nmisconceptions about the difficulties of saddle point optimization and propose\nto extend techniques designed for variational inequalities to the training of\nGANs. We apply averaging, extrapolation and a computationally cheaper variant\nthat we call extrapolation from the past to the stochastic gradient method\n(SGD) and Adam.", "In this paper, we introduce Symplectic ODE-Net (SymODEN), a deep learning\nframework which can infer the dynamics of a physical system, given by an\nordinary differential equation (ODE), from observed state trajectories.

However,\nexisting graph embedding models either fail to incorporate node attribute\ninformation during training or suffer from node attribute noise, which\ncompromises the accuracy. Moreover, very few of them scale to large graphs due\nto their high computational complexity and memory usage. In this paper we\npropose GraphZoom, a multi-level framework for improving both accuracy and\nscalability of unsupervised graph embedding algorithms. GraphZoom first\nperforms graph fusion to generate a new graph that effectively encodes the\ntopology of the original graph and the node attribute information. This fused\ngraph is then repeatedly coarsened into much smaller graphs by merging nodes\nwith high spectral similarities. GraphZoom allows any existing embedding\nmethods to be applied to the coarsened graph, before it progressively refine\nthe embeddings obtained at the coarsest level to increasingly finer graphs. We\nhave evaluated our approach on a number of popular graph datasets for both\ntransductive and inductive tasks. Our experiments show that GraphZoom can\nsubstantially increase the classification accuracy and significantly accelerate\nthe entire graph embedding process by up to 40.8x, when compared to the\nstate-of-the-art unsupervised embedding methods.", "Distributed optimization is vital in solving large-scale machine learning\nproblems. A widely-shared feature of distributed optimization techniques is the\nrequirement that all nodes complete their assigned tasks in each computational\nepoch before the system can proceed to the next epoch. In such settings, slow\nnodes, called stragglers, can greatly slow progress. To mitigate the impact of\nstragglers, we propose an online distributed optimization method called Anytime\nMinibatch. In this approach, all nodes are given a fixed time to compute the\ngradients of as many data samples as possible. The result is a variable\nper-node minibatch size. Workers then get a fixed communication time to average\ntheir minibatch gradients via several rounds of consensus, which are then used\nto update primal variables via dual averaging. Anytime Minibatch prevents\nstragglers from holding up the system without wasting the work that stragglers\ncan complete. We present a convergence analysis and analyze the wall time\nperformance. Our numerical results show that our approach is up to 1.5 times\nfaster in Amazon EC2 and it is up to five times faster when there is greater\nvariability in compute node performance.", "Scaling end-to-end reinforcement learning to control real robots from vision\npresents a series of challenges, in particular in terms of sample efficiency.\nAgainst end-to-end learning, state representation learning can help learn a\ncompact, efficient and relevant representation of states that speeds up policy\nlearning, reducing the number of samples needed, and that is easier to\ninterpret. We evaluate several state representation learning methods on goal\nbased robotics tasks and propose a new unsupervised model that stacks\nrepresentations and combines strengths of several of these approaches. This\nmethod encodes all the relevant features, performs on par or better than\nend-to-end learning with better sample efficiency, and is robust to\nhyper-parameters change.", "A central challenge in reinforcement learning is discovering effective\npolicies for tasks where rewards are sparsely distributed. We postulate that in\nthe absence of useful reward signals, an effective exploration strategy should\nseek out {\\it decision states}. These states lie at critical junctions in the\nstate space from where the agent can transition to new, potentially unexplored\nregions. We propose to learn about decision states from prior experience. By\ntraining a goal-conditioned policy with an information bottleneck, we can\nidentify decision states by examining where the model actually leverages the\ngoal state. We find that this simple mechanism effectively identifies decision\nstates, even in partially observed settings. In effect, the model learns the\nsensory cues that correlate with potential subgoals. In new environments, this\nmodel can then identify novel subgoals for further exploration, guiding the\nagent through a sequence of potential decision states and through new regions\nof the state space.", "Multilingual machine translation, which translates multiple languages with a\nsingle model, has attracted much attention due to its efficiency of offline\ntraining and online serving. However, traditional multilingual translation\nusually yields inferior accuracy compared with the counterpart using individual\nmodels for each language pair, due to language diversity and model capacity\nlimitations. In this paper, we propose a distillation-based approach to boost\nthe accuracy of multilingual machine translation. Specifically, individual\nmodels are first trained and regarded as teachers, and then the multilingual\nmodel is trained to fit the training data and match the outputs of individual\nmodels simultaneously through knowledge distillation. Experiments on IWSLT, WMT\nand Ted talk translation datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.\nParticularly, we show that one model is enough to handle multiple languages (up\nto 44 languages in our experiment), with comparable or even better accuracy\nthan individual models.", "We introduce PyTorch Geometric, a library for deep learning on irregularly\nstructured input data such as graphs, point clouds and manifolds, built upon\nPyTorch.

In particular, it is commonly believed that Gaussian\nencoder/decoder assumptions reduce the effectiveness of VAEs in generating\nrealistic samples. In this regard, we rigorously analyze the VAE objective,\ndifferentiating situations where this belief is and is not actually true. We\nthen leverage the corresponding insights to develop a simple VAE enhancement\nthat requires no additional hyperparameters or sensitive tuning.\nQuantitatively, this proposal produces crisp samples and stable FID scores that\nare actually competitive with a variety of GAN models, all while retaining\ndesirable attributes of the original VAE architecture.

In this paper, we attempted to bridge\nthis gap between adversarial robustness and gradient interpretability. To this\nend, we identified that loss gradients from adversarially trained DNNs align\nbetter with human perception because adversarial training restricts gradients\ncloser to the image manifold.

In this work, we investigate un-normalized energy-based\nmodels (EBMs) which operate not at the token but at the sequence level. In\norder to make training tractable, we first work in the residual of a pretrained\nlocally normalized language model and second we train using noise contrastive\nestimation. Furthermore, since the EBM works at the sequence level, we can\nleverage pretrained bi-directional contextual representations, such as BERT and\nRoBERTa.

This\ndesign removes the mixed and noisy correlations over heterogeneous embeddings\nand offers more expressiveness by using different projection matrices.\nFurthermore, TUPE unties the \\texttt{[CLS]} symbol from other positions, making\nit easier to capture information from all positions. Extensive experiments and\nablation studies on GLUE benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of the\nproposed method. Codes and models are released at\nhttps://github.com/guolinke/TUPE.", "Graph embedding techniques have been increasingly deployed in a multitude of\ndifferent applications that involve learning on non-Euclidean data. However,\nexisting graph embedding models either fail to incorporate node attribute\ninformation during training or suffer from node attribute noise, which\ncompromises the accuracy. Moreover, very few of them scale to large graphs due\nto their high computational complexity and memory usage. In this paper we\npropose GraphZoom, a multi-level framework for improving both accuracy and\nscalability of unsupervised graph embedding algorithms. GraphZoom first\nperforms graph fusion to generate a new graph that effectively encodes the\ntopology of the original graph and the node attribute information. This fused\ngraph is then repeatedly coarsened into much smaller graphs by merging nodes\nwith high spectral similarities. GraphZoom allows any existing embedding\nmethods to be applied to the coarsened graph, before it progressively refine\nthe embeddings obtained at the coarsest level to increasingly finer graphs. We\nhave evaluated our approach on a number of popular graph datasets for both\ntransductive and inductive tasks. Our experiments show that GraphZoom can\nsubstantially increase the classification accuracy and significantly accelerate\nthe entire graph embedding process by up to 40.8x, when compared to the\nstate-of-the-art unsupervised embedding methods.", "Interpretation of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) training as an optimal control\nproblem with nonlinear dynamical systems has received considerable attention\nrecently, yet the algorithmic development remains relatively limited. In this\nwork, we make an attempt along this line by reformulating the training\nprocedure from the trajectory optimization perspective. We first show that most\nwidely-used algorithms for training DNNs can be linked to the Differential\nDynamic Programming (DDP), a celebrated second-order method rooted in the\nApproximate Dynamic Programming. In this vein, we propose a new class of\noptimizer, DDP Neural Optimizer (DDPNOpt), for training feedforward and\nconvolution networks. DDPNOpt features layer-wise feedback policies which\nimprove convergence and reduce sensitivity to hyper-parameter over existing\nmethods. It outperforms other optimal-control inspired training methods in both\nconvergence and complexity, and is competitive against state-of-the-art first\nand second order methods. We also observe DDPNOpt has surprising benefit in\npreventing gradient vanishing. Our work opens up new avenues for principled\nalgorithmic design built upon the optimal control theory.", "In this paper, we investigate the effects of releasing arXiv preprints of\npapers that are undergoing a double-blind review process. In particular, we ask\nthe following research question: What is the relation between de-anonymization\nof authors through arXiv preprints and acceptance of a research paper at a\n(nominally) double-blind venue? Under two conditions: papers that are released\non arXiv before the review phase and papers that are not, we examine the\ncorrelation between the reputation of their authors with the review scores and\nacceptance decisions. By analyzing a dataset of ICLR 2020 and ICLR 2019\nsubmissions (n=5050), we find statistically significant evidence of positive\ncorrelation between percentage acceptance and papers with high reputation\nreleased on arXiv. In order to understand this observed association better, we\nperform additional analyses based on self-specified confidence scores of\nreviewers and observe that less confident reviewers are more likely to assign\nhigh review scores to papers with well known authors and low review scores to\npapers with less known authors, where reputation is quantified in terms of\nnumber of Google Scholar citations. We emphasize upfront that our results are\npurely correlational and we neither can nor intend to make any causal claims.

However, in many practical\napplications, the situation is reversed: an agent may have access to large\namounts of undirected offline experience data, while access to the online\nenvironment is severely limited. In this work, we focus on this offline\nsetting. Our main insight is that, when presented with offline data composed of\na variety of behaviors, an effective way to leverage this data is to extract a\ncontinuous space of recurring and temporally extended primitive behaviors\nbefore using these primitives for downstream task learning. Primitives\nextracted in this way serve two purposes: they delineate the behaviors that are\nsupported by the data from those that are not, making them useful for avoiding\ndistributional shift in offline RL; and they provide a degree of temporal\nabstraction, which reduces the effective horizon yielding better learning in\ntheory, and improved offline RL in practice. In addition to benefiting offline\npolicy optimization, we show that performing offline primitive learning in this\nway can also be leveraged for improving few-shot imitation learning as well as\nexploration and transfer in online RL on a variety of benchmark domains.\nVisualizations are available at https://sites.google.com/view/opal-iclr", "Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and its variants are mainstream methods for\ntraining deep networks in practice.

To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to\ntheoretically and empirically prove that, benefited from the Hessian-dependent\ncovariance of stochastic gradient noise, SGD favors flat minima exponentially\nmore than sharp minima, while Gradient Descent (GD) with injected white noise\nfavors flat minima only polynomially more than sharp minima. We also reveal\nthat either a small learning rate or large-batch training requires\nexponentially many iterations to escape from minima in terms of the ratio of\nthe batch size and learning rate. Thus, large-batch training cannot search flat\nminima efficiently in a realistic computational time.", "Spectral embedding is a popular technique for the representation of graph\ndata.

In order to well-isolate\nthe importance of these properties in learned representations, we impose the\nadditional constraint that, differently from most recent work in ZSL, no\npre-training on different datasets (e.g. ImageNet) is performed. The results of\nour experiments show how locality, in terms of small parts of the input, and\ncompositionality, i.e. how well can the learned representations be expressed as\na function of a smaller vocabulary, are both deeply related to generalization\nand motivate the focus on more local-aware models in future research directions\nfor representation learning.", "We study the problem of learning permutation invariant representations that\ncan capture \"flexible\" notions of containment.

In this work, we present the first comprehensive study of\nregularization techniques with multiple policy optimization algorithms on\ncontinuous control tasks. Interestingly, we find conventional regularization\ntechniques on the policy networks can often bring large improvement, especially\non harder tasks. Our findings are shown to be robust against training\nhyperparameter variations. We also compare these techniques with the more\nwidely used entropy regularization. In addition, we study regularizing\ndifferent components and find that only regularizing the policy network is\ntypically the best. We further analyze why regularization may help\ngeneralization in RL from four perspectives - sample complexity, reward\ndistribution, weight norm, and noise robustness.

Large efforts have been taken to choose the appropriate\nsize because it has a huge influence on the performance and differs\nsignificantly for each dataset. In this paper, we propose an Omni-Scale block\n(OS-block) for 1D-CNNs, where the kernel sizes are decided by a simple and\nuniversal rule. Particularly, it is a set of kernel sizes that can efficiently\ncover the best RF size across different datasets via consisting of multiple\nprime numbers according to the length of the time series. The experiment result\nshows that models with the OS-block can achieve a similar performance as models\nwith the searched optimal RF size and due to the strong optimal RF size capture\nability, simple 1D-CNN models with OS-block achieves the state-of-the-art\nperformance on four time series benchmarks, including both univariate and\nmultivariate data from multiple domains.

A widely-shared feature of distributed optimization techniques is the\nrequirement that all nodes complete their assigned tasks in each computational\nepoch before the system can proceed to the next epoch. In such settings, slow\nnodes, called stragglers, can greatly slow progress. To mitigate the impact of\nstragglers, we propose an online distributed optimization method called Anytime\nMinibatch. In this approach, all nodes are given a fixed time to compute the\ngradients of as many data samples as possible. The result is a variable\nper-node minibatch size. Workers then get a fixed communication time to average\ntheir minibatch gradients via several rounds of consensus, which are then used\nto update primal variables via dual averaging.
