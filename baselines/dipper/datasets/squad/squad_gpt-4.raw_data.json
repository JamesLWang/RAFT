        "In 1954, major Serbian and Croatian writers, linguists and literary critics, backed by Matica srpska and Matica hrvatska signed the Novi Sad Agreement, which in its first conclusion stated: \"Serbs, Croats and Montenegrins share a single language with two equal variants that have developed around Zagreb (western) and Belgrade (eastern)\". The agreement insisted on the equal status of Cyrillic and Latin scripts, and of Ekavian and Ijekavian pronunciations. It also specified that Serbo-Croatian should be the name of the language in official contexts, while in unofficial use the traditional Serbian and Croatian were to be retained. Matica hrvatska and Matica srpska were to work together on a dictionary, and a committee of Serbian and Croatian linguists was asked to prepare a pravopis. During the sixties both books were published simultaneously in Ijekavian Latin in Zagreb and Ekavian Cyrillic in Novi Sad. Yet Croatian linguists claim that it was an act of unitarianism. The evidence supporting this claim is patchy: Croatian linguist Stjepan Babi\u0107 complained that the television transmission from Belgrade",
        "The Bush administration then turned its attention to Iraq, and argued the need to remove Saddam Hussein from power in Iraq had become urgent. Among the stated reasons were that Saddam's regime had tried to acquire nuclear material and had not properly accounted for biological and chemical material it was known to have previously possessed, and believed to still maintain. Both the possession of these weapons of mass destruction (WMD), and the failure to account for them, would violate the U.N. sanctions. The assertion about WMD was hotly advanced by the Bush administration from the beginning, but other major powers including China, France, Germany, and Russia remained unconvinced that Iraq was a threat and refused to allow passage of a UN Security Council resolution to authorize the use of force. Iraq permitted UN weapon inspectors in November 2002, who were continuing their work to assess the WMD claim when the Bush administration decided to proceed with war",
        "An adolescent's environment plays a huge role in their identity development. While most adolescent studies are conducted on white, middle class children, studies show that the more privileged upbringing people have, the more successfully they develop their identity. The forming of an adolescent's identity is a crucial time in their life. It has been recently found that demographic patterns suggest that the transition to adulthood is now occurring over a longer span of years than was the case during the middle of the 20th century. Accordingly, youth, a period that spans late adolescence and early adulthood, has become a more prominent stage of the life course. This therefore has caused various factors to become important during this development. So many factors contribute to the developing social identity of an adolescent from commitment, to coping devices, to social media. All of these factors are affected by the environment an adolescent grows up in.",
        "Compared to other team sports, the National Football League preseason is very structured. Every NFL team plays exactly four pre-season exhibition games a year, two at home and two away, with the exception of two teams each year who play a fifth game, the Pro Football Hall of Fame Game. These exhibition games, most of which are held in the month of August, are played for the purpose of helping coaches narrow down the roster from the offseason limit of 90 players to the regular-season limit of 53 players. While the scheduling formula is not as rigid for preseason games as they are for the regular season, there are numerous restrictions and traditions that limit the choices of preseason opponents; teams are also restricted on what days and times they can play these games. Split-squad games, a practice common in baseball and hockey, where a team that is scheduled to play two games on the same day splits their team into two squads, are prohibited. The NFL has played",
        "In practice, not all rule violations will result in a disqualification as the referee may use their own judgement and is not obligated to stop the match. Usually, the only offenses that the referee will see and immediately disqualify the match on (as opposed to having multiple offenses) are low blows, weapon usage, interference, or assaulting the referee. In WWE, a referee must see the violation with their own eyes to rule that the match end in a disqualification (simply watching the video tape is not usually enough) and the referee's ruling is almost always final, although Dusty finishes (named after, and made famous by, Dusty Rhodes) will often result in the referee's decision being overturned. It is not uncommon for the referees themselves to get knocked out during a match, which is commonly referred to by the term \"ref bump\". While the referee remains \"unconscious\", wrestlers are free to violate rules until the referee is revived",
        "In the 15th century the dome was added and the naves extended back of the choir, uniting the building to the tower and forming a main entrance. Archbishop Luis Alfonso de los Cameros began the building of the main chapel in 1674; the walls were decorated with marbles and bronzes in the Baroque style of that period. At the beginning of the 18th century the German Conrad Rudolphus built the fa\u00e7ade of the main entrance. The other two doors lead into the transept; one, that of the Apostles in pure pointed Gothic, dates from the 14th century, the other is that of the Pal\u00e1u. The additions made to the back of the cathedral detract from its height. The 18th-century restoration rounded the pointed arches, covered the Gothic columns with Corinthian pillars, and redecorated the walls. The dome has no lantern, its plain ceiling being pierced by two large side windows. There are four chapels on either side, besides that at the end and those that open into the choir, the transept, and the sanctuary. It contains many paintings by eminent artists.",
        "Early reviews were mixed in their assessment. Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly considered that \"As TV, American Idol is crazily entertaining; as music, it's dust-mote inconsequential\". Others, however, thought that \"the most striking aspect of the series was the genuine talent it revealed\". It was also described as a \"sadistic musical bake-off\", and \"a romp in humiliation\". Other aspects of the show have attracted criticisms. The product placement in the show in particular was noted, and some critics were harsh about what they perceived as its blatant commercial calculations \u2013 Karla Peterson of The San Diego Union-Tribune charged that American Idol is \"a conniving multimedia monster\" that has \"absorbed the sin of our debauched culture and spit them out in a lump of reconstituted evil\".

        "To extend and consolidate the dynasty's control in Central Asia, the Kangxi Emperor personally led a series of military campaigns against the Dzungars in Outer Mongolia. The Kangxi Emperor was able to successfully expel Galdan's invading forces from these regions, which were then incorporated into the empire. Galdan was eventually killed in the Dzungar\u2013Qing War. In 1683, Qing forces received the surrender of Taiwan from Zheng Keshuang, grandson of Koxinga, who had conquered Taiwan from the Dutch colonists as a base against the Qing.

        "Libya's economy witnessed increasing privatization; although rejecting the socialist policies of nationalized industry advocated in The Green Book, government figures asserted that they were forging \"people's socialism\" rather than capitalism. Gaddafi welcomed these reforms, calling for wide-scale privatization in a March 2003 speech. In 2003, the oil industry was largely sold to private corporations, and by 2004, there was $40 billion of direct foreign investment in Libya, a sixfold rise over 2003. Sectors of Libya's population reacted against these reforms with public demonstrations, and in March 2006, revolutionary hard-liners took control of the GPC cabinet; although scaling back the pace of the changes, they did not halt them. In 2010, plans were announced that would have seen half the Libyan economy privatized over the following decade. While there was no accompanying political liberalization, with Gaddafi retaining predominant control, in March 2010, the government devolved further powers to the municipal councils.

        "Mammalian hair, also known as pelage, can vary in color between populations, organisms within a population, and even on the individual organism. Light-dark color variation is common in the mammalian taxa. Sometimes, this color variation is determined by age variation, however, in other cases, it is determined by other factors. Selective pressures, such as ecological interactions with other populations or environmental conditions, often lead to the variation in mammalian coloration. These selective pressures favor certain colors in order to increase survival. Camouflage is thought to be a major selection pressure shaping coloration in mammals, although there is also evidence that sexual selection, communication, and physiological processes may influence the evolution of coloration as well. Camouflage is the most predominant mechanism for color variation, as it aids in the concealment of the organisms from predators or from their prey. Coat color can also be for intraspecies communication such as warning members of their species about predators,",
        "But in the mid-18th century, during the French Enlightenment, a more ideological use of the term had come into use. In 1765, the author of an anonymous article in a French Enlightenment periodical spoke of \"The general love of humanity ... a virtue hitherto quite nameless among us, and which we will venture to call 'humanism', for the time has come to create a word for such a beautiful and necessary thing\". The latter part of the 18th and the early 19th centuries saw the creation of numerous grass-roots \"philanthropic\" and benevolent societies dedicated to human betterment and the spreading of knowledge (some Christian, some not). After the French Revolution, the idea that human virtue could be created by human reason alone independently from traditional religious institutions, attributed by opponents of the Revolution to Enlightenment philosophes such as Rousseau, was violently attacked by influential religious and political conservatives, such",

        "Emotions can motivate social interactions and relationships and therefore are directly related with basic physiology, particularly with the stress systems. This is important because emotions are related to the anti-stress complex, with an oxytocin-attachment system, which plays a major role in bonding. Emotional phenotype temperaments affect social connectedness and fitness in complex social systems (Kurt Kortschal 2013). These characteristics are shared with other species and taxa and are due to the effects of genes and their continuous transmission. Information that is encoded in the DNA sequences provides the blueprint for assembling proteins that make up our cells. Zygotes require genetic information from their parental germ cells, and at every speciation event, heritable traits that have enabled its ancestor to survive and reproduce successfully are passed down along with new traits that could be potentially beneficial to the offspring. In the five million years since the linages leading to modern humans and chimpanzees split, only about 1.2% of",

Tracy and Trethewey (2005) state that \"individuals gravitate toward and turn away from particular jobs depending in part, on the extent to which they validate a \"preferred organizational self\" (Tracy & Tretheway 2005, p. 169).

        "Jeffrey Long and Rick Kittles give a long critique of the application of FST to human populations in their 2003 paper \"Human Genetic Diversity and the Nonexistence of Biological Races\". They find that the figure of 85% is misleading because it implies that all human populations contain on average 85% of all genetic diversity. They claim that this does not correctly reflect human population history, because it treats all human groups as independent. A more realistic portrayal of the way human groups are related is to understand that some human groups are parental to other groups and that these groups represent paraphyletic groups to their descent groups. For example, under the recent African origin theory the human population in Africa is paraphyletic to all other human groups because it represents the ancestral group from which all non-African populations derive, but more than that, non-African groups only derive from a small non-representative sample of this African population. This means that all non-African groups are more closely related to each other and to some African groups (probably east Africans) than they are to others, and further that the migration out of Africa represented a",
        "The book was widely translated in Darwin's lifetime, but problems arose with translating concepts and metaphors, and some translations were biased by the translator's own agenda. Darwin distributed presentation copies in France and Germany, hoping that suitable applicants would come forward, as translators were expected to make their own arrangements with a local publisher. He welcomed the distinguished elderly naturalist and geologist Heinrich Georg Bronn, but the German translation published in 1860 imposed Bronn's own ideas, adding controversial themes that Darwin had deliberately omitted. Bronn translated \"favoured races\" as \"perfected races\", and added essays on issues including the origin of life, as well as a final chapter on religious implications partly inspired by Bronn's adherence to Naturphilosophie. In 1862, Bronn produced a second edition based on the third English edition and Darwin's suggested additions, but then died of a heart attack. Darwin corresponded closely with Julius Victor Carus, who published an improved translation in 1867. Darwin's attempts to find",
        "Hegel certainly intends to preserve what he takes to be true of German idealism, in particular Kant's insistence that ethical reason can and does go beyond finite inclinations. For Hegel there must be some identity of thought and being for the \"subject\" (any human observer)) to be able to know any observed \"object\" (any external entity, possibly even another human) at all. Under Hegel's concept of \"subject-object identity,\" subject and object both have Spirit (Hegel's ersatz, redefined, nonsupernatural \"God\") as their conceptual (not metaphysical) inner reality\u2014and in that sense are identical. But until Spirit's \"self-realization\" occurs and Spirit graduates from Spirit to Absolute Spirit status, subject (a human mind) mistakenly thinks every \"object\" it observes is something \"alien,\" meaning something separate or apart from \"subject.\" In Hegel's words, \"The object is revealed to it [to \"subject\"] by [as] something alien, and it does not recognize itself.\" Self-realization occurs when Hegel (part of Spirit's nonsupernatural Mind, which",

It is doubtful whether a referendum in Strasbourg would have ended in France's favour since the political parties striving for an autonomous Alsace or a connection to France accounted only for a small proportion of votes in the last Reichstag as well as in the local elections. The Alsatian autonomists who were pro French had won many votes in the more rural parts of the region and other towns since the annexation of the region by Germany in 1871.

As a result, Zhejiang has made itself one of the richest provinces, and the \"Zhejiang spirit\" has become something of a legend within China. However, some economists now worry that this model is not sustainable, in that it is inefficient and places unreasonable demands on raw materials and public utilities, and also a dead end, in that the myriad small businesses in Zhejiang producing cheap goods in bulk are unable to move to more sophisticated or technologically more advanced industries.

The executive branch acted in the name of the King (\"His Majesty's Government\"), as did the judiciary. The King's Ministers were in most cases members of one of the two Houses of Parliament, and the Government needed to sustain the support of a majority in the House of Commons. One minister, the Lord Chancellor, was at the same time the sole judge in the Court of Chancery and the presiding officer in the House of Lords. Therefore, it may be seen that the three branches of British government often violated the strict principle of separation of powers, even though there were many occasions when the different branches of the government disagreed with each other.

They ran into difficulties when attempting to confiscate the holdings of the English kings in southern France, leading to the Hundred Years' War, waged from 1337 to 1453. Early in the war the English under Edward III (r. 1327\u201377) and his son Edward, the Black Prince (d. 1376),[AF] won the battles of Cr\u00e9cy and Poitiers, captured the city of Calais, and won control of much of France.[AG] The resulting stresses almost caused the disintegration of the French kingdom during the early years of the war.

The Sages there explain that Zant tried to destroy it, but he was only able to shatter it into fragments; only the true ruler of the Twili can completely destroy the Mirror of Twilight. They also reveal that they used it a century ago to banish Ganondorf, the Gerudo leader who attempted to steal the Triforce, to the Twilight Realm when executing him failed. Assisted by an underground resistance group they meet in Castle Town, Link and Midna set out to retrieve the missing shards of the Mirror, defeating those they infected. Once the portal has been restored, Midna is revealed to be the true",

In ice hockey, the Irish were forced to find a new conference home after the Big Ten Conference's decision to add the sport in 2013\u201314 led to a cascade of conference moves that culminated in the dissolution of the school's former hockey home, the Central Collegiate Hockey Association, after the 2012\u201313 season.

Through the persuasion of Jeremiah Dummer, Yale, who had made a fortune through trade while living in Madras as a representative of the East India Company, donated nine bales of goods, which were sold for more than \u00a3560, a substantial sum at the time.

Although many Jews once had sufficient knowledge of Hebrew to study the classic literature, and Jewish languages like Yiddish and Ladino were commonly used as recently as the early 20th century, most Jews lack such knowledge today and English has by and large superseded most Jewish vernaculars. The three most commonly spoken languages among Jews today are Hebrew, English, and Russian. Some Romance languages, particularly French and Spanish, are also widely used.

Galicia was incorporated into the Roman Empire at the end of the Cantabrian Wars in 19 BC, being turned into a Roman province in the 3rd century AD. In 410, the Germanic Suebi established a kingdom with its capital in Braga (Portugal) which was incorporated into that of the Visigoths in 585. In 711, the Arabs invaded the Iberian Peninsula, taking the Visigoth kingdom, but soon in 740 Galicia was incorporated into the Christian kingdom of Asturias. During the Middle Ages, the kingdom of Galicia was occasionally ruled by its own kings, but most of the time it was leagued to the kingdom of Leon and later to that of Castile, while maintaining its own",
        "Birds have a very efficient system for diffusing oxygen into the blood; birds have a ten times greater surface area to gas exchange volume than mammals. As a result, birds have more blood in their capillaries per unit of volume of lung than a mammal. The arteries are composed of thick elastic muscles to withstand the pressure of the ventricular constriction, and become more rigid as they move away from the heart. Blood moves through the arteries, which undergo vasoconstriction, and into arterioles which act as a transportation system to distribute primarily oxygen as well as nutrients to all tissues of the body. As the arterioles move away from the heart and into individual organs and tissues they are further divided to increase surface area and slow blood flow. Travelling through the arterioles blood moves into the capillaries where gas exchange can occur. Capillaries are organized into capillary beds in tissues, it is here that blood exchanges oxygen for carbon",

Nagumo executed a first strike against Midway, while Fletcher launched his aircraft, bound for Nagumo's carriers. At 09:20 the first U.S. carrier aircraft arrived, TBD Devastator torpedo bombers from Hornet, but their attacks were poorly coordinated and ineffectual; thanks in part to faulty aerial torpedoes, they failed to score a single hit and all 15 were wiped out by defending Zero fighters. At 09:35, 15 additional TBDs from Enterprise attacked in which 14 were lost, again with no hits. Thus far, Fletcher's attacks had been disorganized and seemingly ineffectual, but they succeeded in drawing Nagumo's defensive fighters down to sea level where they expended much of their fuel and ammunition repulsing the two waves of torpedo bombers.

        "Vladimir had been prince of Novgorod when his father Sviatoslav I died in 972. He was forced to flee to Scandinavia in 976 after his half-brother Yaropolk had murdered his other brother Oleg and taken control of Rus. In Scandinavia, with the help of his relative Earl H\u00e5kon Sigurdsson, ruler of Norway, Vladimir assembled a Viking army and reconquered Novgorod and Kiev from Yaropolk. As Prince of Kiev, Vladimir's most notable achievement was the Christianization of Kievan Rus', a process that began in 988. The Primary Chronicle states that when Vladimir had decided to accept a new faith instead of the traditional idol-worship (paganism) of the Slavs, he sent out some of his most valued advisors and warriors as emissaries to different parts of Europe. They visited the Christians of the Latin Rite, the Jews, and the Muslims before finally arriving in Constantinople. They rejected Islam because, among other things, it prohibited the consumption of alcohol, and Judaism because the god of the Jews had permitted his chosen people to",
        "Identity development is a stage in the adolescent life cycle. For most, the search for identity begins in the adolescent years. During these years, adolescents are more open to 'trying on' different behaviours and appearances to discover who they are. In other words, in an attempt to find their identity and discover who they are adolescents are liking to cycle through a number of identities to find one that suits them best. But, developing and maintaining identity (in adolescent years) is a difficult task due to multiple factors such as family life, environment, and social status. Empirical studies suggest that this process might be more accurately described as identity development, rather than formation, but confirms a normative process of change in both content and structure of one's thoughts about the self. The two main aspects of identity development are self-clarity and self-esteem. Since choices made during adolescent years can influence later life, high levels of self-awareness and self-control during mid-adolescence will lead to better decisions during the transition to adulthood.[citation needed] Researchers have used three general approaches to understanding identity development: self-concept, sense of identity, and self-esteem.

Peter of Alexandria, the 17th archbishop of Alexandria, was martyred in 311 in the closing days of that persecution, and may have been one of those teachers. His successor as bishop of Alexandria, Alexander of Alexandria (312\u2013328) was an Origenist as well as a documented mentor of Athanasius. According to Sozomen, Bishop Alexander \"invited Athanasius to be his commensal and secretary. He had been well educated, and was versed in grammar and rhetoric, and had already, while still a young man, and before reaching the episcopate, given proof to those who dwelt with him of his wisdom and acumen\".

        "Egocentrism in adolescents forms a self-conscious desire to feel important in their peer groups and enjoy social acceptance. Unlike the conflicting aspects of self-concept, identity represents a coherent sense of self stable across circumstances and including past experiences and future goals. Everyone has a self-concept, whereas Erik Erikson argued that not everyone fully achieves identity. Erikson's theory of stages of development includes the identity crisis in which adolescents must explore different possibilities and integrate different parts of themselves before committing to their beliefs. He described the resolution of this process as a stage of \"identity achievement\" but also stressed that the identity challenge \"is never fully resolved once and for all at one point in time\". Adolescents begin by defining themselves based on their crowd membership. \"Clothes help teens explore new identities, separate from parents, and bond with peers.\" Fashion has played a major role when it comes to teenagers \"finding their selves\"; Fashion is always evolving, which corresponds with the evolution of change",
        "Stanley Schachter formulated his theory on the earlier work of a Spanish physician, Gregorio Mara\u00f1\u00f3n, who injected patients with epinephrine and subsequently asked them how they felt. Interestingly, Mara\u00f1\u00f3n found that most of these patients felt something but in the absence of an actual emotion-evoking stimulus, the patients were unable to interpret their physiological arousal as an experienced emotion. Schachter did agree that physiological reactions played a big role in emotions. He suggested that physiological reactions contributed to emotional experience by facilitating a focused cognitive appraisal of a given physiologically arousing event and that this appraisal was what defined the subjective emotional experience. Emotions were thus a result of two-stage process: general physiological arousal, and experience of emotion. For example, the physiological arousal, heart pounding, in a response to an evoking stimulus, the sight of a bear in the kitchen. The brain then quickly scans the area, to explain",

Due to a revolt by Han in Liaodong in 1623, Nurhachi, who previously gave concessions to conquered Han subjects in Liaodong, turned against them and ordered that they no longer be trusted; He enacted discriminatory policies and killings against them, while ordering that Han who assimilated to the Jurchen (in Jilin) before 1619 be treated equally as Jurchens were and not like the conquered Han in Liaodong.

In most Jewish populations, these male line ancestors appear to have been mainly Middle Eastern. For example, Ashkenazi Jews share more common paternal lineages with other Jewish and Middle Eastern groups than with non-Jewish populations in areas where Jews lived in Eastern Europe, Germany and the French Rhine Valley. This is consistent with Jewish traditions in placing most Jewish paternal origins in the region of the Middle East. Conversely, the maternal lineages of Jewish populations, studied by looking at mitochondrial DNA, are generally more heterogeneous. Scholars such as Harry Ostrer and Raphael Falk believe this indicates that many Jewish males found new mates from European and other communities in the places where they migrated in the diaspora after fleeing ancient Israel. In contrast, Behar has found evidence that",

        "In contemporary society, adolescents also face some risks as their sexuality begins to transform. While some of these, such as emotional distress (fear of abuse or exploitation) and sexually transmitted infections/diseases (STIs/STDs), including HIV/AIDS, are not necessarily inherent to adolescence, others such as teenage pregnancy (through non-use or failure of contraceptives) are seen as social problems in most western societies. One in four sexually active teenagers will contract an STI. Adolescents in the United States often chose \"anything but intercourse\" for sexual activity because they mistakenly believe it reduces the risk of STIs. Across the country, clinicians report rising diagnoses of herpes and human papillomavirus (HPV), which can cause genital warts, and is now thought to affect 15 percent of the teen population. Girls 15 to 19 have higher rates of gonorrhea than any other age group. One-quarter of all new HIV cases occur in those under the age of 21.

There is effectively no ethnic distinction between black and white Bermudians, other than those characterising recent immigrant communities. In the 17th century, this was not so. For the first hundred years of settlement, white Protestants of English heritage were the distinct majority, with white minorities of Irish (the native language of many of whom can be assumed to have been Gaelic) and Scots sent to Bermuda after the English invasions of their homelands that followed the English Civil War. Non-white minorities included Spanish-speaking, free (indentured) blacks from the West Indies, black chattel slaves primarily captured from Spanish and Portuguese ships by Bermudian privateers, and Native Americans, primarily from the Algonquian and other tribes of the Atlantic seaboard, but possibly from as far away as Mexico.

        "The body\u2019s capability to react to antigen depends on a person's age, antigen type, maternal factors and the area where the antigen is presented. Neonates are said to be in a state of physiological immunodeficiency, because both their innate and adaptive immunological responses are greatly suppressed. Once born, a child\u2019s immune system responds favorably to protein antigens while not as well to glycoproteins and polysaccharides. In fact, many of the infections acquired by neonates are caused by low virulence organisms like Staphylococcus and Pseudomonas. In neonates, opsonic activity and the ability to activate the complement cascade is very limited. For example, the mean level of C3 in a newborn is approximately 65% of that found in the adult. Phagocytic activity is also greatly impaired in newborns. This is due to lower opsonic activity, as well as diminished up-regulation of integrin and selectin receptors, which limit the ability of neutrophils to interact with adhesion molecules in the endothelium. Their monocytes are slow and have a reduced ATP production, which also limits the newborn's phagocytic activity.",

        "Like the reptiles, birds are primarily uricotelic, that is, their kidneys extract nitrogenous waste from their bloodstream and excrete it as uric acid instead of urea or ammonia through the ureters into the intestine. Birds do not have a urinary bladder or external urethral opening and (with exception of the ostrich) uric acid is excreted along with feces as a semisolid waste. However, birds such as hummingbirds can be facultatively ammonotelic, excreting most of the nitrogenous wastes as ammonia. They also excrete creatine, rather than creatinine like mammals. This material, as well as the output of the intestines, emerges from the bird's cloaca. The cloaca is a multi-purpose opening: waste is expelled through it, most birds mate by joining cloaca, and females lay eggs from it. In addition, many species of birds regurgitate pellets. Males within Palaeognathae (with the exception of the kiwis), the Anseriformes (with the exception",

Stalin immediately directed Molotov to \"purge the ministry of Jews.\" Given Litvinov's prior attempts to create an anti-fascist coalition, association with the doctrine of collective security with France and Britain, and pro-Western orientation by the standards of the Kremlin, his dismissal indicated the existence of a Soviet option of rapprochement with Germany.[f] Likewise, Molotov's appointment served as a signal to Germany that the USSR was open to offers. The dismissal also signaled to France and Britain the existence of a potential negotiation option with Germany.

Once elected, a priest held permanent religious authority from the eternal divine, which offered him lifetime influence, privilege and immunity. Therefore, civil and religious law limited the number and kind of religious offices allowed an individual and his family. Religious law was collegial and traditional; it informed political decisions, could overturn them, and was difficult to exploit for personal gain. Priesthood was a costly honour: in traditional Roman practice, a priest drew no stipend.

Nintendo wanted to distinguish its product from those of competitors and to avoid the generally poor reputation that game consoles had acquired following the video game crash of 1983. One result of this philosophy was to disguise the cartridge slot design as a front-loading zero insertion force (ZIF) cartridge socket, designed to resemble the front-loading mechanism of a VCR. The newly designed connector worked quite well when both the connector and the cartridges were clean and the pins on the connector were new. Unfortunately, the ZIF connector was not truly zero insertion force.

The myth of Danaus, whose origin is Egypt, is a foundation legend of Argos. His daughters Danaides, were forced in Tartarus to carry a jug to fill a bathtub without a bottom. This myth is connected with a task that can never be fulfilled (Sisyphos) and the name can be derived from the PIE root *danu: \"river\". There is not any satisfactory theory on their origin. Some scholars connect Danaans with the Denyen, one of the groups of the sea peoples who attacked Egypt during the reign of Ramesses III (1187-1156 BCE).

The cluster structure of the genetic data is therefore dependent on the initial hypotheses of the researcher and the populations sampled. When one samples continental groups, the clusters become continental; if one had chosen other sampling patterns, the clustering would be different. Weiss and Fullerton have noted that if one sampled only Icelanders, Mayans and Maoris, three distinct clusters would form and all other populations could be described as being clinally composed of admixtures of Maori, Icelandic and Mayan genetic materials.

In the basic ladder match, the wrestlers or teams of wrestlers must climb a ladder to obtain a prize that is hoisted above the ring.

As a result, the ladder can be used as a weapon.

        "By March 2011, the market share of OS X in North America had increased to slightly over 14%. Whether the size of the Mac's market share and installed base is relevant, and to whom, is a hotly debated issue. Industry pundits have often called attention to the Mac's relatively small market share to predict Apple's impending doom, particularly in the early and mid-1990s when the company's future seemed bleakest. Others argue that market share is the wrong way to judge the Mac's success. Apple has positioned the Mac as a higher-end personal computer, and so it may be misleading to compare it to a budget PC. Because the overall market for personal computers has grown rapidly, the Mac's increasing sales numbers are effectively swamped by the industry's expanding sales volume as a whole. Apple's small market share, then, gives the impression that fewer people are using Macs than did ten years ago, when exactly the opposite is true.",
        "The '98 season would begin on a somber note with the death of legendary broadcaster Harry Caray. After the retirement of Sandberg and the trade of Dunston, the Cubs had holes to fill and the signing of Henry Rodr\u00edguez, known affectionately as \"H-Rod\" to bat cleanup provided protection for Sammy Sosa in the lineup, as Rodriguez slugged 31 round-trippers in his first season in Chicago. Kevin Tapani led the club with a career high 19 wins, Rod Beck anchored a strong bullpen and Mark Grace turned in one of his best seasons. The Cubs were swamped by media attention in 1998, and the team's two biggest headliners were Sosa and rookie flamethrower Kerry Wood. Wood's signature performance was one-hitting the Houston Astros, a game in which he tied the major league record of 20 strikeouts in nine innings. His torrid strikeout numbers earned Wood the nickname \"Kid K,\" and ultimately earned him the 1998 NL Rookie of the Year award. Sosa caught fire in June, hitting a major",

        "A true predator can commonly be known as one that kills and eats another living thing. Whereas other types of predator all harm their prey in some way, this form kills them. Predators may hunt actively for prey in pursuit predation, or sit and wait for prey to approach within striking distance, as in ambush predators. Some predators kill large prey and dismember or chew it prior to eating it, such as a jaguar or a human; others may eat their (usually much smaller) prey whole, as does a bottlenose dolphin swallowing a fish, or a snake, duck or stork swallowing a frog. Some animals that kill both large and small prey for their size (domestic cats and dogs are prime examples) may do either depending upon the circumstances; either would devour a large insect whole but dismember a rabbit. Some predation entails venom that subdues a prey creature before the predator ingests the prey by killing, which the box jellyfish does, or disabling it, found",

Ubayd-Allah bin Ziyad managed to disperse the crowd that gathered around Muslim bin Agail and captured him.

Eastland believes that the founders of affirmative action did not anticipate how the benefits of affirmative action would go to those who did not need it, mostly middle class minorities. Additionally, she argues that affirmative action carries with it a stigma that can create feelings of self-doubt and entitlement in minorities. Eastland believes that affirmative action is a great risk that only sometimes pays off, and that without it we would be able to compete more freely with one another. Libertarian economist Thomas Sowell identified what he says are negative results of affirmative action in his book, Affirmative Action Around the World: An Empirical Study.

        "From his diagrams of a small number of particles interacting in spacetime, Feynman could then model all of physics in terms of the spins of those particles and the range of coupling of the fundamental forces. Feynman attempted an explanation of the strong interactions governing nucleons scattering called the parton model. The parton model emerged as a complement to the quark model developed by his Caltech colleague Murray Gell-Mann. The relationship between the two models was murky; Gell-Mann referred to Feynman's partons derisively as \"put-ons\". In the mid-1960s, physicists believed that quarks were just a bookkeeping device for symmetry numbers, not real particles, as the statistics of the Omega-minus particle, if it were interpreted as three identical strange quarks bound together, seemed impossible if quarks were real.

John's relief operation was blocked by Philip's forces, and John turned back to Brittany in an attempt to draw Philip away from eastern Normandy.

        "In 2013, however, a study of Ashkenazi mitochondrial DNA by a team led by Martin B. Richards of the University of Huddersfield in England reached different conclusions, again corroborating the pre-2006 origin hypothesis. Testing was performed on the full 16,600 DNA units composing mitochondrial DNA (the 2006 Behar study had only tested 1,000 units) in all their subjects, and the study found that the four main female Ashkenazi founders had descent lines that were established in Europe 10,000 to 20,000 years in the past while most of the remaining minor founders also have a deep European ancestry. The study states that the great majority of Ashkenazi maternal lineages were not brought from the Near East (i.e., they were non-Israelite), nor were they recruited in the Caucasus (i.e., they were non-Khazar), but instead they were assimilated within Europe, primarily of Italian and Old French origins. Richards summarized the findings on the female line as such: \"[N]one [of the mtDNA] came from the North Caucasus, located along the border",

It was at this time that Eisenhower voiced his disagreements with the Democratic party and declared himself and his family to be Republicans. A \"Draft Eisenhower\" movement in the Republican Party persuaded him to declare his candidacy in the 1952 presidential election to counter the candidacy of non-interventionist Senator Robert A.

The effort was a long struggle; Eisenhower had to be convinced that political circumstances had created a genuine duty for him to offer himself as a candidate, and that there was a mandate from the populace for him to be their President.

Most theories on self-esteem state that there is a grand desire, across all genders and ages, to maintain, protect and enhance their self-esteem. Contrary to popular belief, there is no empirical evidence for a significant drop in self-esteem over the course of adolescence. \"Barometric self-esteem\" fluctuates rapidly and can cause severe distress and anxiety, but baseline self-esteem remains highly stable across adolescence. The validity of global self-esteem scales has been questioned, and many suggest that more specific scales might reveal more about the adolescent experience.

It gave her 20% royalties from the music proceedings, one of the highest rates in the industry, equaled at that time only by Michael Jackson's royalty rate established a year earlier with Sony. The first release from the venture was Madonna's book, titled Sex. It consisted of sexually provocative and explicit images, photographed by Steven Meisel. The book received strong negative reaction from the media and the general public, but sold 1.5 million",
        "When John's elder brother Richard became king in September 1189, he had already declared his intention of joining the Third Crusade. Richard set about raising the huge sums of money required for this expedition through the sale of lands, titles and appointments, and attempted to ensure that he would not face a revolt while away from his empire. John was made Count of Mortain, was married to the wealthy Isabel of Gloucester, and was given valuable lands in Lancaster and the counties of Cornwall, Derby, Devon, Dorset, Nottingham and Somerset, all with the aim of buying his loyalty to Richard whilst the king was on crusade. Richard retained royal control of key castles in these counties, thereby preventing John from accumulating too much military and political power, and, for the time being, the king named the four-year-old Arthur of Brittany as the heir to the throne. In return, John promised not to visit England for the next three years, thereby in theory giving",
        "Usually a Presbyterian church will not have statues of saints, nor the ornate altar more typical of a Roman Catholic church. Instead, one will find a \"communion table,\" usually on the same level as the congregation. There may be a rail between the communion table and the \"Chancel\" behind it, which may contain a more decorative altar-type table, choir loft, or choir stalls, lectern and clergy area. The altar is called the communion table and the altar area is called the Chancel by Presbyterians. In a Presbyterian (Reformed Church) there may be an altar cross, either on the communion table or on a table in the chancel. By using the \"empty\" cross, or cross of the resurrection, Presbyterians emphasize the resurrection and that Christ is not continually dying, but died once and is alive for all eternity. Some Presbyterian church buildings are often decorated with a cross that has a circle around the center, or Celtic cross.",

The Sena dynasty would later assume control of the Pala Empire, and the Gurjara Pratiharas fragmented into various states. These were the first of the Rajput states. The first recorded Rajput kingdoms emerged in Rajasthan in the 6th century, and small Rajput dynasties later ruled much of northern India. One Gurjar Rajput of the Chauhan clan, Prithvi Raj Chauhan, was known for bloody conflicts against the advancing Turkic sultanates.

        "The polyphony of Christian a cappella music began to develop in Europe around the late 15th century, with compositions by Josquin des Prez. The early a cappella polyphonies may have had an accompanying instrument, although this instrument would merely double the singers' parts and was not independent. By the 16th century, a cappella polyphony had further developed, but gradually, the cantata began to take the place of a cappella forms. 16th century a cappella polyphony, nonetheless, continued to influence church composers throughout this period and to the present day. Recent evidence has shown that some of the early pieces by Palestrina, such as what was written for the Sistine Chapel was intended to be accompanied by an organ \"doubling\" some or all of the voices. Such is seen in the life of Palestrina becoming a major influence on Bach, most notably in the aforementioned Mass in B Minor. Other composers that utilized the a cappella style, if only for the occasional piece, were Claudio Monteverdi and his masterpiece, Lagrime d'amante al sepolcro dell'amata (A lover's tears at his beloved's grave), which",
        "Though Britain and the empire emerged victorious from the Second World War, the effects of the conflict were profound, both at home and abroad. Much of Europe, a continent that had dominated the world for several centuries, was in ruins, and host to the armies of the United States and the Soviet Union, who now held the balance of global power. Britain was left essentially bankrupt, with insolvency only averted in 1946 after the negotiation of a $US 4.33 billion loan (US$56 billion in 2012) from the United States, the last instalment of which was repaid in 2006. At the same time, anti-colonial movements were on the rise in the colonies of European nations. The situation was complicated further by the increasing Cold War rivalry of the United States and the Soviet Union. In principle, both nations were opposed to European colonialism. In practice, however, American anti-communism prevailed over anti-imperialism, and therefore the United States supported the continued existence of the British Empire to",

Plymouth was attacked five times before the end of the month while Belfast, Hull, and Cardiff were hit. Cardiff was bombed on three nights, Portsmouth centre was devastated by five raids. The rate of civilian housing lost was averaging 40,000 people per week dehoused in September 1940. In March 1941, two raids on Plymouth and London dehoused 148,000 people. Still, while heavily damaged, British ports continued to support war industry and supplies from North America continued to pass through them while the Royal Navy continued to operate in Plymouth, Southampton, and Portsmouth. Plymouth in particular, because of its vulnerable position on the south coast and close proximity to German air bases, was subjected to the heaviest attacks. On",
        "By far the largest military action in which the United States engaged during this era was the War of 1812. With Britain locked in a major war with Napoleon's France, its policy was to block American shipments to France. The United States sought to remain neutral while pursuing overseas trade. Britain cut the trade and impressed seamen on American ships into the Royal Navy, despite intense protests. Britain supported an Indian insurrection in the American Midwest, with the goal of creating an Indian state there that would block American expansion. The United States finally declared war on the United Kingdom in 1812, the first time the U.S. had officially declared war. Not hopeful of defeating the Royal Navy, the U.S. attacked the British Empire by invading British Canada, hoping to use captured territory as a bargaining chip. The invasion of Canada was a debacle, though concurrent wars with Native Americans on the western front (Tecumseh's War",

John hoped to acquire Normandy, Anjou and the other lands in France held by Richard in exchange for allying himself with Philip. John was persuaded not to pursue an alliance by his mother. Longchamp, who had left England after Walter's intervention, now returned, and argued that he had been wrongly removed as justiciar. John intervened, suppressing Longchamp's claims in return for promises of support from the royal administration, including a reaffirmation of his position as heir to the throne. When Richard still did not return from the crusade, John began to assert that his brother was dead or otherwise permanently lost. Richard had in fact been captured en route to England by the Duke of Austria and was handed over to Emperor Henry VI, who held him for ransom. John seized the opportunity and went",
        "Although people often think that memory operates like recording equipment, it is not the case. The molecular mechanisms underlying the induction and maintenance of memory are very dynamic and comprise distinct phases covering a time window from seconds to even a lifetime. In fact, research has revealed that our memories are constructed. People can construct their memories when they encode them and/or when they recall them. To illustrate, consider a classic study conducted by Elizabeth Loftus and John Palmer (1974) in which people were instructed to watch a film of a traffic accident and then asked about what they saw. The researchers found that the people who were asked, \"How fast were the cars going when they smashed into each other?\" gave higher estimates than those who were asked, \"How fast were the cars going when they hit each other?\" Furthermore, when asked a week later whether they have seen broken glass in the film, those who had been asked the",

        "Following the fall of Wu and the turmoil of the Wu Hu uprising against the Jin dynasty (265\u2013420), most of elite Chinese families had collaborated with the non-Chinese rulers and military conquerors in the north. Some may have lost social privilege, and took refugee in areas south to Yangtze River. Some of the Chinese refugees from north China might have resided in areas near Hangzhou. For example, the clan of Zhuge Liang (181\u2013234), a chancellor of the state of Shu Han from Central Plain in north China during the Three Kingdoms period, gathered together at the suburb of Hangzhou, forming an exclusive, closed village Zhuge Village (Zhege Cun), consisting of villagers all with family name \"Zhuge\". The village has intentionally isolated itself from the surrounding communities for centuries to this day, and only recently came to be known in public. It suggests that a small number of powerful, elite Chinese refugees from the Central Plain might have taken refugee in south of the Yangtze River. However, considering",
        "A common way in which emotions are conceptualized in sociology is in terms of the multidimensional characteristics including cultural or emotional labels (e.g., anger, pride, fear, happiness), physiological changes (e.g., increased perspiration, changes in pulse rate), expressive facial and body movements (e.g., smiling, frowning, baring teeth), and appraisals of situational cues. One comprehensive theory of emotional arousal in humans has been developed by Jonathan Turner (2007: 2009). Two of the key eliciting factors for the arousal of emotions within this theory are expectations states and sanctions. When people enter a situation or encounter with certain expectations for how the encounter should unfold, they will experience different emotions depending on the extent to which expectations for Self, other and situation are met or not met. People can also provide positive or negative sanctions directed at Self or other which also trigger different emotional experiences in individuals. Turner analyzed a wide range of emotion theories across different fields of research",

The relay was initially supposed to cover 28 km, but it was shortened at the demand of Chinese officials following widespread protests by pro-Tibet and human rights activists, who repeatedly attempted to disrupt, hinder or halt the procession. A scheduled ceremony at the town hall was cancelled at the request of the Chinese authorities, and, also at the request of Chinese authorities, the torch finished the relay by bus instead of being carried by athletes. Paris City officials had announced plans to greet the Olympic flame with peaceful protest when the torch was to reach the French capital.

        "The United States has become essentially a two-party system. Since a conservative (such as the Republican Party) and liberal (such as the Democratic Party) party has usually been the status quo within American politics. The first parties were called Federalist and Republican, followed by a brief period of Republican dominance before a split occurred between National Republicans and Democratic Republicans. The former became the Whig Party and the latter became the Democratic Party. The Whigs survived only for two decades before they split over the spread of slavery, those opposed becoming members of the new Republican Party, as did anti-slavery members of the Democratic Party. Third parties (such as the Libertarian Party) often receive little support and are very rarely the victors in elections. Despite this, there have been several examples of third parties siphoning votes from major parties that were expected to win (such as Theodore Roosevelt in the election of 1912 and George Wallace in the election of 1968). As third party movements have learned, the Electoral College's requirement of a nationally distributed majority makes it difficult for third parties to succeed. Thus,",
        "Darwin was hard at work on his \"big book\" on Natural Selection, when on 18 June 1858 he received a parcel from Wallace, who stayed on the Maluku Islands (Ternate and Gilolo). It enclosed twenty pages describing an evolutionary mechanism, a response to Darwin's recent encouragement, with a request to send it on to Lyell if Darwin thought it worthwhile. The mechanism was similar to Darwin's own theory. Darwin wrote to Lyell that \"your words have come true with a vengeance, ... forestalled\" and he would \"of course, at once write and offer to send [it] to any journal\" that Wallace chose, adding that \"all my originality, whatever it may amount to, will be smashed\".

        "Early Modern universities initially continued the curriculum and research of the Middle Ages: natural philosophy, logic, medicine, theology, mathematics, astronomy (and astrology), law, grammar and rhetoric. Aristotle was prevalent throughout the curriculum, while medicine also depended on Galen and Arabic scholarship. The importance of humanism for changing this state-of-affairs cannot be underestimated. Once humanist professors joined the university faculty, they began to transform the study of grammar and rhetoric through the studia humanitatis. Humanist professors focused on the ability of students to write and speak with distinction, to translate and interpret classical texts, and to live honorable lives. Other scholars within the university were affected by the humanist approaches to learning and their linguistic expertise in relation to ancient texts, as well as the ideology that advocated the ultimate importance of those texts. Professors of medicine such as Niccol\u00f2 Leoniceno, Thomas Linacre and William Cop were often trained in and taught from a humanist perspective as well as translated important ancient medical texts. The critical mindset imparted by humanism was imperative for changes in",
        "The two major types of nonprofit organization are membership and board-only. A membership organization elects the board and has regular meetings and the power to amend the bylaws. A board-only organization typically has a self-selected board, and a membership whose powers are limited to those delegated to it by the board. A board-only organization's bylaws may even state that the organization does not have any membership, although the organization's literature may refer to its donors or service recipients as \"members\"; examples of such organizations are Fairvote and the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws. The Model Nonprofit Corporation Act imposes many complexities and requirements on membership decision-making. Accordingly, many organizations, such as Wikimedia, have formed board-only structures. The National Association of Parliamentarians has generated concerns about the implications of this trend for the future of openness, accountability, and understanding of public concerns in nonprofit organizations. Specifically, they note that nonprofit organizations, unlike business corporations, are not subject to",

They even established a major garrison in Sicily in case the Seleucids ever got to Italy. This fear was shared by Rome's Greek allies, who had largely ignored Rome in the years after the Second Macedonian War, but now followed Rome again for the first time since that war. A major Roman-Greek force was mobilized under the command of the great hero of the Second Punic War, Scipio Africanus, and set out for Greece, beginning the Roman-Syrian War. After initial fighting that revealed serious Seleucid weaknesses, the Seleucids tried to turn the Roman strength against them at the Battle of Thermopylae (as they believed the 300 Spartans had done centuries earlier). Like the Spartans, the Seleucids lost the battle, and were forced to evacuate Greece. The Romans pursued the Seleucids by crossing the Hellespont, which marked the first time a Roman army had ever entered Asia. The decisive engagement was fought at",

Disfellowshipping, a form of shunning, is the strongest form of discipline, administered to an offender deemed unrepentant. Contact with disfellowshipped individuals is limited to direct family members living in the same home, and with congregation elders who may invite disfellowshipped persons to apply for reinstatement; formal business dealings may continue if contractually or financially obliged.

        "Many cultures define the transition into adultlike sexuality by specific biological or social milestones in an adolescent's life. For example, menarche (the first menstrual period of a female), or semenarche (the first ejaculation of a male) are frequent sexual defining points for many cultures. In addition to biological factors, an adolescent's sexual socialization is highly dependent upon whether their culture takes a restrictive or permissive attitude toward teen or premarital sexual activity. Restrictive cultures overtly discourage sexual activity in unmarried adolescents or until an adolescent undergoes a formal rite of passage. These cultures may attempt to restrict sexual activity by separating males and females throughout their development, or through public shaming and physical punishment when sexual activity does occur. In less restrictive cultures, there is more tolerance for displays of adolescent sexuality, or of the interaction between males and females in public and private spaces. Less restrictive cultures may tolerate some aspects of adolescent sexuality, while objecting to other aspects.",

The fall of Vienna provided the French a huge bounty as they captured 100,000 muskets, 500 cannons, and the intact bridges across the Danube. At this critical juncture, both Tsar Alexander I and Holy Roman Emperor Francis II decided to engage Napoleon in battle, despite reservations from some of their subordinates. Napoleon sent his army north in pursuit of the Allies, but then ordered his forces to retreat so that he could feign a grave weakness. Desperate to lure the Allies into battle, Napoleon gave every indication in the days preceding the engagement that the French army was in a pitiful state, even abandoning the dominant Pratzen Heights near the village of Austerlitz. At the Battle of Austerlitz, in Moravia on 2 December, he deployed the French army below the Pratzen Heights and deliberately weakened his right flank, enticing the Allies to launch a major assault there in the hopes of rolling up the whole French line.

Shortly after gaining independence, the day to celebrate it varied between September 16, the day of Hidalgo's Grito, and September 27, the day Iturbide rode into Mexico City to end the war. Later, political movements would favor the more liberal Hidalgo over the conservative Iturbide, so that eventually September 16, 1810 became the officially recognized day of Mexican independence.

Although hymnographers and scholars, like the Emperor Justinian I, were accustomed to call Mary \"prepurified\" in their poetic and credal statements, the first point of departure for more fully commenting on Nazianzen's meaning occurs in Sophronius of Jerusalem. In other places Sophronius explains that the Theotokos was already immaculate, when she was \"purified\" at the Annunciation and goes so far as to note that John the Baptist is literally \"holier than all 'Men' born of woman\" since Mary's surpassing holiness signifies that she was holier than even John after his sanctification in utero.

Although the movements of peoples during this period are usually described as \"invasions\", they were not just military expeditions but migrations of entire peoples into the empire. Such movements were aided by the refusal of the western Roman elites to support the army or pay the taxes that would have allowed the military to suppress the migration. The emperors of the 5th century were often controlled by military strongmen such as Stilicho (d. 408), Aspar (d. 471), Ricimer (d. 472), or Gundobad (d. 516), who were partly or fully of non-Roman background. When the line of western emperors ceased, many of the kings who replaced them were from the same background. Intermarriage between the new kings and the Roman elites was common. This led to a fusion of Roman culture with the customs of the invading tribes, including the popular assemblies that allowed",

Professors lectured on the books of Aristotle for logic, natural philosophy, and metaphysics; while Hippocrates, Galen, and Avicenna were used for medicine. Outside of these commonalities, great differences separated north and south, primarily in subject matter. Italian universities focused on law and medicine, while the northern universities focused on the arts and theology. There were distinct differences in the quality of instruction in these areas which were congruent with their focus, so scholars would travel north or south based on their interests and means. There was also a difference in the types of degrees awarded at these universities. English, French and German universities usually awarded bachelor's degrees, with the exception",

In the competition for students and financial support, college leaders strove to keep current with demands for innovation. At the same time, they realized that a significant portion of their students and prospective students demanded a classical background. The Yale report meant the classics would not be abandoned. All institutions experimented with changes in the curriculum, often resulting in a dual track.

In the UK, Nicole records, made of celluloid or a similar substance coated onto a cardboard core disc, were produced for a few years beginning in 1904, but they suffered from an exceptionally high level of surface noise. In the United States, Columbia Records introduced flexible, fiber-cored \"Marconi Velvet Tone Record\" pressings in 1907, but the advantages and longevity of their relatively noiseless surfaces depended on the scrupulous use of special gold-plated Marconi Needles and the product was not a success.

        "While medieval pageants and festivals such as Corpus Christi were church-sanctioned, Carnival was also a manifestation of medieval folk culture. Many local Carnival customs are claimed to derive from local pre-Christian rituals, such as elaborate rites involving masked figures in the Swabian\u2013Alemannic Fastnacht. However, evidence is insufficient to establish a direct origin from Saturnalia or other ancient festivals. No complete accounts of Saturnalia survive and the shared features of feasting, role reversals, temporary social equality, masks and permitted rule-breaking do not necessarily constitute a coherent festival or link these festivals. These similarities may represent a reservoir of cultural resources that can embody multiple meanings and functions. For example, Easter begins with the resurrection of Jesus, followed by a liminal period and ends with rebirth. Carnival reverses this as King Carnival comes to life, a liminal period follows before his death. Both feasts are calculated by the lunar calendar. Both Jesus and King Carnival may be seen as expiatory",
        "Education in Israel is highly valued in the national culture with its historical values dating back to Ancient Israel and was viewed as one fundamental blocks of ancient Israelite life. Israeli culture views higher education as the key to higher mobility and socioeconomic status in Israeli society. The emphasis of education within Israeli society goes to the gulf within the Jewish diaspora from the Renaissance and Enlightenment Movement all the way to the roots of Zionism in the 1880s. Jewish communities in the Levant were the first to introduce compulsory education for which the organized community, not less than the parents, was responsible for the education of the next generation of Jews. With contemporary Jewish culture's strong emphasis, promotion of scholarship and learning and the strong propensity to promote cultivation of intellectual pursuits as well as the nations high university educational attainment rate exemplifies how highly Israeli society values higher education. The Israeli education system has been praised for various reasons, including its high quality and its major role in spurring Israel's economic development and technological boom.

        "Protestantism also spread from the German lands into France, where the Protestants were nicknamed Huguenots. Calvin continued to take an interest in the French religious affairs from his base in Geneva. He regularly trained pastors to lead congregations there. Despite heavy persecution, the Reformed tradition made steady progress across large sections of the nation, appealing to people alienated by the obduracy and the complacency of the Catholic establishment. French Protestantism came to acquire a distinctly political character, made all the more obvious by the conversions of nobles during the 1550s. This established the preconditions for a series of conflicts, known as the French Wars of Religion. The civil wars gained impetus with the sudden death of Henry II of France in 1559. Atrocity and outrage became the defining characteristics of the time, illustrated at their most intense in the St. Bartholomew's Day massacre of August",
        "Adolescence marks a rapid change in one's role within a family. Young children tend to assert themselves forcefully, but are unable to demonstrate much influence over family decisions until early adolescence, when they are increasingly viewed by parents as equals. The adolescent faces the task of increasing independence while preserving a caring relationship with his or her parents. When children go through puberty, there is often a significant increase in parent\u2013child conflict and a less cohesive familial bond. Arguments often concern minor issues of control, such as curfew, acceptable clothing, and the adolescent's right to privacy, which adolescents may have previously viewed as issues over which their parents had complete authority. Parent-adolescent disagreement also increases as friends demonstrate a greater impact on one another, new influences on the adolescent that may be in opposition to parents' values. Social media has also played an increasing role in adolescent and parent disagreements. While parents never had to worry about the threats of social media in the past, it",

In May 1987, Gaddafi announced the start of the \"Revolution within a Revolution\", which began with reforms to industry and agriculture and saw the re-opening of small business. Restrictions were placed on the activities of the Revolutionary Committees; in March 1988, their role was narrowed by the newly created Ministry for Mass Mobilization and Revolutionary Leadership to restrict their violence and judicial role, while in August 1988 Gaddafi publicly criticised them, asserting that \"they deviated, harmed, tortured\" and that \"the true revolutionary does not practise repression.\" In March, hundreds of political prisoners were freed, with Gaddafi falsely claiming that there were no further political prisoners in Libya.

        "In response to the early-to-mid-17th century \"continental rationalism\" John Locke (1632\u20131704) proposed in An Essay Concerning Human Understanding (1689) a very influential view wherein the only knowledge humans can have is a posteriori, i.e., based upon experience. Locke is famously attributed with holding the proposition that the human mind is a tabula rasa, a \"blank tablet\", in Locke's words \"white paper\", on which the experiences derived from sense impressions as a person's life proceeds are written. There are two sources of our ideas: sensation and reflection. In both cases, a distinction is made between simple and complex ideas. The former are unanalysable, and are broken down into primary and secondary qualities. Primary qualities are essential for the object in question to be what it is. Without specific primary qualities, an object would not be what it is. For example, an apple is an apple because of the arrangement of",

Freddie Mercury (then known by his birth name of Farrokh \"Freddie\" Bulsara) was a fan of Smile and encouraged them to experiment with more elaborate stage and recording techniques. Mercury joined the band in 1970, suggested \"Queen\" as a new band name, and adopted his familiar stage name. John Deacon was recruited prior to recording their eponymous debut album in 1973. Queen first charted in the UK with their second album, Queen II, in 1974, but it was the release of Sheer Heart Attack later that year and A Night at the Opera in 1975 which brought them international success. The latter featured \"Bohemian Rhapsody\", which stayed at number one in the UK for nine weeks and popularised the music video.

The Parian Chronicle says that Phthia was the homeland of the Hellenes and that this name was given to those previously called Greeks (\u0393\u03c1\u03b1\u03b9\u03ba\u03bf\u03af). In Greek mythology, Hellen, the patriarch of Hellenes, was son of Pyrrha and Deucalion, who ruled around Phthia, the only survivors after the great deluge. It seems that the myth was invented when the Greek tribes started to separate from each other in certain areas of Greece and it indicates their common origin. Aristotle names ancient Hellas as an area in Epirus between Dodona and the Achelous river, the location of the great deluge of Deucalion, a land occupied by the Selloi and the \"Greeks\" who later came to be known as \"Hellenes\".

However, they were alarmed by the Greek Cypriot calls for enosis as they saw the union of Crete with Greece, which led to the exodus of Cretan Turks, as a precedent to be avoided, and they took a pro-partition stance in response to the militant activity of EOKA. The Turkish Cypriots also viewed themselves as a distinct ethnic group of the island and believed in their having a separate right to self-determination from Greek Cypriots. Meanwhile, in the 1950s, Turkish leader Menderes considered Cyprus an \"extension of Anatolia\", rejected the partition of Cyprus along ethnic lines and favoured the annexation of the whole island to Turkey. Nationalistic slogans centred on the idea that \"Cyprus is Turkish\" and the ruling party declared Cyprus to be a part of the Turkish homeland that was vital to its security.

There is general agreement that US technological superiority was a crucial factor but the speed and scale of the Iraqi collapse has also been attributed to poor strategic and tactical leadership and low morale among Iraqi troops, which resulted from a history of incompetent leadership. After devastating initial strikes against Iraqi air defenses and command and control facilities on 17 January 1991, coalition forces achieved total air superiority almost immediately. The Iraqi air force was destroyed within a few days, with some planes fleeing to Iran, where they were interned for the duration of the conflict. The overwhelming technological advantages of the US, such as stealth aircraft and infrared sights, quickly turned the air war into a \"turkey shoot\".

As Europeans encountered people from different parts of the world, they speculated about the physical, social, and cultural differences among various human groups.

Soils usually need to be fairly heavy, although the level of nutrients does not need to be exceptional. In general, these conditions are met within the seasonally dry tropics and subtropics in the Northern and Southern hemispheres, but a large proportion of the cotton grown today is cultivated in areas with less rainfall that obtain the water from irrigation. Production of the crop for a given year usually starts soon after harvesting the preceding autumn. Cotton is naturally a perennial but is grown as an annual to help control pests. Planting time in spring in the Northern hemisphere varies from the beginning of February to the beginning of June.

Beginning with St. Gregory Nazianzen, his explanation of the \"purification\" of Jesus and Mary at the circumcision (Luke 2:22) prompted him to consider the primary meaning of \"purification\" in Christology (and by extension in Mariology) to refer to a perfectly sinless nature that manifested itself in glory in a moment of grace (e.g., Jesus at his Baptism). St. Gregory Nazianzen designated Mary as \"prokathartheisa (prepurified).\" Gregory likely attempted to solve the riddle of the Purification of Jesus and Mary in the Temple through considering the human natures of Jesus and Mary as equally holy and therefore both purified in this manner of grace and glory. Gregory's doctrines surrounding Mary's purification were likely related to the burgeoning commemoration of the Mother of God in and around Constantinople very close to the date of Christmas.

For example, in the early 1980s, prior to the appearance of AZT for the treatment of AIDS, the course of the disease was closely followed by monitoring the composition of patient blood samples, even though the outcome would not offer the patient any further treatment options. In part, these studies on the appearance of HIV in specific communities permitted the advancement of hypotheses as to the route of transmission of the virus. By understanding how the disease was transmitted, resources could be targeted to the communities at greatest risk in campaigns aimed at reducing the number of new infections. The specific serological diagnostic identification, and later genotypic or molecular identification, of HIV also enabled the development of hypotheses as to the temporal and",

In a notable letter to Marshal Soult detailing the plan for the campaign, Napoleon described the essential features of Napoleonic warfare and introduced the phrase le bataillon-carr\u00e9 ('square battalion'). In the bataillon-carr\u00e9 system, the various corps of the Grande Arm\u00e9e would march uniformly together in close supporting distance. If any single corps was attacked, the others could quickly spring into action and arrive to help. Napoleon invaded Prussia with 180,000 troops, rapidly marching on the right bank of the River Saale. As in previous campaigns, his fundamental objective was to destroy one opponent before reinforcements from another could tip the balance of the war. Upon learning the whereabouts of the Prussian army, the French swung westwards and crossed the Saale with overwhelming force.

This reveals that the Islamic world was interconnected in the early modern period as they travelled around to other Islamic states exchanging knowledge. This sense that the Ottoman Empire was becoming modernised through globalization is also recognised by Hamadeh who says: \"Change in the eighteenth century as the beginning of a long and unilinear march toward westernisation reflects the two centuries of reformation in sovereign identity.\" \u0130nalc\u0131k also mentions that while scholars from for example Persia travelled to the Ottomans in order to share their knowledge, Ottomans travelled as well to receive education from scholars of these Islamic lands, such as Egypt, Persia and Turkestan.

Jefferson refused to issue Proclamations of Thanksgiving sent to him by Congress during his presidency, though he did issue a Thanksgiving and Prayer proclamation as Governor of Virginia. Madison issued four religious proclamations while President, but vetoed two bills on the grounds they violated the first amendment. On the other hand, both Jefferson and Madison attended religious services at the Capitol. Years before the ratification of the Constitution, Madison contended \"Because if Religion be exempt from the authority of the Society at large, still less can it be subject to that of the Legislative Body.\" After retiring from the presidency, Madison wrote of \"total separation of the church from the state.\" \" \"Strongly guarded as is the separation between Religion & Govt in the Constitution of the United States,\" Madison wrote, and he declared, \"practical distinction between Religion and Civil Government is essential to the purity of both, and as guaranteed by the Constitution",

Whereas Zeppelin broke up almost immediately afterwards, AC/DC pressed on, recording the album Back in Black (1980) with their new lead singer, Brian Johnson. It became the fifth-highest-selling album of all time in the US and the second-highest-selling album in the world. Black Sabbath had split with original singer Ozzy Osbourne in 1979 and replaced him with Ronnie James Dio, formerly of Rainbow, giving the band a new sound and a period of creativity and popularity beginning with Heaven and Hell (1980).

        "Boundaries can be inclusive or exclusive depending on how they are perceived by other people. An exclusive boundary arises, for example, when a person adopts a marker that imposes restrictions on the behaviour of others. An inclusive boundary is created, by contrast, by the use of a marker with which other people are ready and able to associate. At the same time, however, an inclusive boundary will also impose restrictions on the people it has included by limiting their inclusion within other boundaries. An example of this is the use of a particular language by a newcomer in a room full of people speaking various languages. Some people may understand the language used by this person while others may not. Those who do not understand it might take the newcomer's use of this particular language merely as a neutral sign of identity. But they might also perceive it as imposing an exclusive boundary that is meant to mark them off from her. On the other hand, those who do understand the newcomer's language",
        "To maintain a high constant body temperature is energy expensive \u2013 mammals therefore need a nutritious and plentiful diet. While the earliest mammals were probably predators, different species have since adapted to meet their dietary requirements in a variety of ways. Some eat other animals \u2013 this is a carnivorous diet (and includes insectivorous diets). Other mammals, called herbivores, eat plants. A herbivorous diet includes subtypes such as fruit-eating and grass-eating. An omnivore eats both prey and plants. Carnivorous mammals have a simple digestive tract, because the proteins, lipids, and minerals found in meat require little in the way of specialized digestion. Plants, on the other hand, contain complex carbohydrates, such as cellulose. The digestive tract of an herbivore is therefore host to bacteria that ferment these substances, and make them available for digestion. The bacteria are either housed in the multichambered stomach or in a large cecum. The size of an animal is also a factor in determining diet type. Since small mammals have a high ratio of heat-losing surface area to heat-generating volume, they tend to have high energy requirements and a high metabolic rate. Mammals that",

The University of Texas employs the \"Top Ten Percent Law\", under which admission to any public college or university in Texas is guaranteed to high school students who graduate in the top ten percent of their high school class. Fisher has brought the admissions policy to court because she believes that she was denied acceptance to the University of Texas based on her race, and thus, her right to equal protection according to the 14th Amendment was violated.

Neutral Sections usually consist of an earthed section of wire which is separated from the live wires on either side by insulating material, typically ceramic beads, designed so that the pantograph will smoothly run from one section to the other. The earthed section prevents an arc being drawn from one live section to the other, as the voltage difference may be higher than the normal system voltage if the live sections are on different phases and the protective circuit breakers may not be able to safely interrupt the considerable current that would flow.

The caf\u00e9 arrived in Paris in the 17th century, when the beverage was first brought from Turkey, and by the 18th century Parisian caf\u00e9s were centres of the city's political and cultural life.

The popular description of the order was: \"To keep the hair, you lose the head; To keep your head, you cut the hair.\" To the Manchus, this policy was a test of loyalty and an aid in distinguishing friend from foe. For the Han Chinese, however, it was a humiliating reminder of Qing authority that challenged traditional Confucian values. The Classic of Filial Piety (Xiaojing) held that \"a person's body and hair, being gifts from one's parents, are not to be damaged.\" Under the Ming dynasty, adult men did not cut their hair but instead wore it in the form of a top-knot.

As an adolescent's social sphere develops rapidly as they distinguish the differences between friends and acquaintances, they often become heavily emotionally invested in friends. This is not harmful; however, if these friends expose an individual to potentially harmful situations, this is an aspect of peer pressure. Adolescence is a critical period in social development because adolescents can be easily influenced by the people they develop close relationships with. This is the first time individuals can truly make their own decisions, which also makes this a sensitive period. Relationships are vital in the social development of an adolescent due to the extreme influence peers can have over an individual. These relationships become significant because",

In his view, faith was a free work of the Holy Spirit and could, therefore, not be forced on a person. The persecuted Anabaptists and Huguenots demanded freedom of conscience, and they practised separation of church and state. In the early seventeenth century, Baptists like John Smyth and Thomas Helwys published tracts in defense of religious freedom.

The aim of this project was to harmonize the Serbo-Croatian language, which was marked by great diversity and regional variations, as a way to solidify the unity within the newly formed socialist state. A Novi Sad Agreement, held in the city in northern Serbia, was a pivotal moment in this undertaking. The parties agreed upon a plan that would recognize four dialects and two scripts, both Latin and Cyrillic, as equally valid and official. They also agreed to work on shared vocabulary, grammar, and orthography. Despite the political undercurrents and tensions, the Novi Sad Agreement represented a commendable effort by intellectuals from diverse backgrounds to promote linguistic unity and harmony.

Among the stated reasons were the alleged possession of weapons of mass destruction and the fostering of terrorism by the Hussein regime. The Bush administration claimed that Iraq was in breach of the UN Security Council\u2019s Resolution 1441, which demanded Iraq to disarm itself of any chemical, biological or nuclear weapons it held. The administration also accused Saddam Hussein of supporting terrorist groups, thus posing a direct threat to the United States and its allies.

        "An adolescent's environment plays a huge role in their identity development. While most adolescent studies are conducted on white, middle-class children, studies show that this demographic does not represent the entirety of teenage experiences. Adolescents from diverse racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic backgrounds encounter different environmental factors that significantly impact their identity development.\n\nFor instance, adolescents from lower-income environments may face challenges related to poverty, such as limited educational resources or exposure to violence, which can affect their self-perception and aspirations. On the other hand, adolescents from wealthier backgrounds may experience immense pressure to succeed, which can also impact their identity formation. These environmental factors, coupled with the intrinsic complexities of race and culture, shape a unique identity development trajectory for each adolescent, underscoring the importance of context in understanding adolescent development. Therefore, it is vital for future research to explore these diverse experiences to offer a more comprehensive picture of adolescent identity development.",

Exercising discretion allows referees to maintain the flow of the game, ensuring that it isn't constantly interrupted by minor infractions. An important part of this discretion is understanding the intent behind a rule. While the rules provide a framework, they are not always black and white. For example, a minor technical violation that does not impact the outcome of a play might be overlooked while a serious foul that jeopardizes player safety would be swiftly punished. The referee, therefore, plays a critical role not only in enforcing the rules but also in interpreting them in the spirit of fairness and sportsmanship.

Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly considered that \"As TV, American Idol is crazily entertaining; as music, it's disappointingly flat.\" Indeed, the spectacle of raw talent showcased on the platform was compelling, but the musical output was often deemed lackluster. Critics argued that the show's format, emphasizing speed and competitiveness, might not necessarily foster a true understanding or appreciation of music.\n\nOther critics perceived a different issue. They claimed that the show promoted a poppy, overproduced style of music, which is far removed from the raw creativity that stirs the soul. This was a sentiment echoed by many viewers who believed that the show's contestants were more performers than musicians, focusing more on entertaining and less on creating unique, soulful music.\n\nHowever, regardless of the reviews, American Idol has remained a popular show, proving that it has tapped into a certain aspect of the public's desire for entertainment. Ultimately, it's a testament to the show's ability to adapt and stay relevant, despite the mixed reviews.",
        "Intense media interest in the opinions and private lives of the royal family during the 1980s led to a series of sensational stories in the press, creating a period of unprecedented scrutiny for the British monarchy. The most infamous of these revolved around Prince Charles and Princess Diana, whose marriage, separation, and subsequent divorce were played out in a media circus. Their every action and comment was dissected, leading to immense pressure on an already strained relationship.\n\nThis heightened attention wasn't limited to Charles and Diana. Allegations of infidelity concerning other family members also frequently surfaced, casting a long shadow over the reputation of the monarchy. It wasn't all negative, however. The press also celebrated royal births, weddings and milestones, capturing the public's imagination and reinforcing the monarchy's place in British society.\n\nDespite these challenges, the royal family adapted to the new media landscape, realizing the power of the press and using it to manage their public image - a strategy still employed today.",

        "To extend and consolidate the dynasty's control in Central Asia, the Kangxi Emperor personally led a series of military campaigns against the Dzungars, a confederation of Mongol tribes. A significant historical figure, the Kangxi Emperor, whose reign spanned from 1661 to 1722, was renowned for his military prowess and strategic acumen.\n\nThe Dzungars posed a persistent threat to the stability of the Qing dynasty, prompting a rigorous response from the emperor. Commencing in 1677 and not concluding until 1680, this relentless campaign was a testament to the emperor's determination to secure his empire's borders. The Kangxi Emperor's reunification of China under Qing rule was largely due to his successful campaigns against the Dzungars, resulting in a more secure and expansive empire. This consolidation of power fortified the dynasty's control over Central Asia, effectively curbing the Dzungar menace.\n\nThe Kangxi Emperor's military campaigns signify a pivotal period in China's history, reflecting",
        "From the 1970s onward, Stuart Hall's pioneering work, along with that of his colleagues Paul Willis, Dick Hebdige, Tony Jefferson, and Angela McRobbie, set the stage for a new approach in cultural studies. They emphasized the central role of culture in shaping societal behaviors and attitudes, marking a clear shift from traditional sociological perspectives. Hall, in particular, was instrumental in challenging the idea that culture was simply a manifestation of societal structures. Instead, he argued that culture played a vital role in shaping these structures. Willis, Hebdige, Jefferson, and McRobbie supported this view, each contributing unique perspectives. Willis focused on the 'cultural reproduction' of social class, while Hebdige explored subcultural styles and resistance. Jefferson studied subcultures within the realm of criminology, and McRobbie explored gender and youth culture. Together, their work has had a profound influence on the field of cultural studies, igniting important debates and laying the",
        "Libya's economy witnessed increasing privatization; although rejecting the socialist policies of nationalized industry advocated in The Green Book, government figures asserted that they were not completely abandoning socialism. Instead, they touted their reformative approach as a new type of economic model, dubbed \"popular capitalism\". The premise behind this model is to allow the masses to own the means of production, thereby maintaining Libyans' involvement in their country's economy while concurrently embracing market-oriented strategies to boost the economy.\n\nThis move towards privatization has been palpable in various sectors, notably in telecommunications, banking, and oil. However, the privatisation process has been uneven and often hampered by bureaucratic red-tape and corruption. Nevertheless, the government's resolve remains firm to gradually lessen the state's control over the economy, and allow Libyans to partake more significantly in the country's economic affairs. Only time will tell if this hybrid model of popular capitalism will bring the desired economic prosperity to this North African nation.",
        "Mammalian hair, also known as pelage, can vary in color between populations, organisms within a population, and even on the individual. This color variation is largely determined by the type and amount of pigments in the hair follicles. The primary pigments are eumelanin, which produces brown or black hair, and pheomelanin, which results in yellow or red hair. These pigments are produced by specialized cells known as melanocytes, and the balance between them can shift due to genetic, environmental, or hormonal factors. For example, changes in temperature or diet can affect the production of these pigments, leading to seasonal color changes in some species. Additionally, aging can also cause a decrease in pigment production, resulting in the graying of hair. Moreover, some mammals have hair that lacks pigmentation altogether, producing white or clear hair. The study of mammalian hair color is a fascinating aspect of evolutionary biology, offering insights into adaptation, survival strategies, and species",
        "But in the mid-18th century, during the French Enlightenment, a more ideological use of the term had come into use. In this revolutionary era, the concept of 'enlightenment' began to signify a radical departure from the confinements of traditional thought and religious dogmas. It was an era of thinkers, philosophers, and scholars who espoused reason, individualism, and progress. The term 'enlightenment', hence, began to represent the intellectual transition from the darkness of ignorance into the light of knowledge. Figures such as Voltaire, Rousseau, and Diderot led this movement, challenging the established norms and advocating for a society guided by reason rather than faith. They campaigned fiercely for the freedom of thought, speech, and press, contributing to a major shift in societal values and government paradigms. Their ideas shaped the modern world, giving rise to secularism, human rights, constitutional government, and the separation of church and state. Thus, the mid-18",
        "More commonly, in cases where there are three or more parties, no one party is likely to gain power alone, and parties work with each other to form a coalition government. This is a very common form of government in many democratic countries such as Germany, Israel, and India. Under a coalition government, political parties negotiate and compromise to form a government together, with each party holding a proportion of government positions. This system encourages cooperation and negotiation, enabling diverse voices to be heard and represented. However, such a system can also lead to instability if the parties have too many disagreements or if one party decides to withdraw its support. Despite the potential challenges, coalition governments offer a more inclusive political platform, reflecting a wider range of public opinion, and ensuring that power isn't concentrated in the hands of a single party.",
        "Emotions can motivate social interactions and relationships and therefore are directly related with basic physiology, particularly with the stress systems. This is important because emotions are powerful signals that communicate our inner state to others, shaping our social bonds and interactions. They can foster or hinder relationships, drive cooperation or conflict, and mediate between personal desires and group needs. \n\nThe connection between emotions and stress systems is intricate. Stress impacts emotions and vice versa. Prolonged stress can result in emotional imbalance, such as anxiety or depression, which can disrupt social interactions and relationships. Contrarily, positive emotions can help to buffer stress, enhancing resilience and coping mechanisms. \n\nMoreover, emotions are pivotal in decision-making processes. They can influence our judgments and ultimately our behaviours, which in turn can impact our social relationships. Thus, recognizing and managing emotions is crucial for maintaining physiological balance and fostering healthy social interactions. This underscores the need for emotional intelligence in our everyday lives.",
        "The implications are multiple as various research traditions are now heavily utilizing the lens of identity to examine phenomena. One implication is the profound impact on the field of social science. Identity is now used as a pivotal point in analyzing societal trends, behaviors, and norms. This shift recognizes the individual's role in shaping and being shaped by the societal context.\n\nAnother implication is seen in the field of psychology. By utilizing identity as a framework, it allows for a deeper examination of human behavior, emotions, and cognition. It helps understand how individuals perceive themselves and how this self-perception influences their interaction with the world.\n\nFinally, the business sector has also felt the impact. Marketing strategies, for example, now often hinge on the concept of identity. Businesses analyze the identities of their target audience to create more tailored, effective campaigns. This underscores the evolving importance of identity in various research traditions and its far-reaching implications.",

They take a detailed look at the practice of using FST (Fixation Index), a statistical measure used in genetics, to quantify genetic diversity and differentiate human populations or races. They argue that the use of FST in this context may oversimplify the complex nature of human genetic diversity.\n\nLong and Kittles emphasize that human populations are not strictly genetically distinct groups with definite boundaries, but rather exist as a continuum of genetic variation. They further point out that overuse of FST can lead to an erroneous interpretation of human genetic diversity, possibly reinforcing outdated and potentially harmful notions of race.\n\nThrough their paper, Long and Kittles call for a more nuanced approach to studying human genetic diversity, one that takes into account the intricate nature of human genetic variation and avoids oversimplification that may lead to misinterpret",
        "The book was widely translated in Darwin's lifetime, but problems arose with translating concepts and metaphors, and some translations were biased by the translator's own beliefs or cultural contexts. This was the challenge faced with Charles Darwin's seminal work, \"On the Origin of Species.\" Its complex scientific theories, expressed in the nuanced language of the 19th century English, posed significant difficulties for translators.\n\nSome of these translations, unfortunately, skewed the meaning of Darwin's ideas, colored by the translator's personal convictions or societal influences. For instance, in the Russian version, Darwin's theories were interpreted within a strict materialistic framework, a reflection of the prevailing Marxist ideology. In contrast, the Italian translation was influenced by the Catholic Church's stance on evolution, subtly modifying Darwin's arguments.\n\nHowever, these biased translations, instead of undermining the book, enriched its discourse.

        "Hegel certainly intends to preserve what he takes to be true of German idealism, in particular Kant's insistence that ethical reason can and does provide substantial guidance for human conduct. This tenet places a significant emphasis on the moral autonomy of individuals and their ability to discern right from wrong based purely on rational thought. \n\nHegel, however, diverges from Kant in his rejection of the latter's deontological ethics. While Kant argues for moral principles based on a universal law, Hegel insists on the contextual nature of morality. In his view, ethical conduct should be determined by the historical and social reality in which it is embedded. \n\nHegel\u2019s dialectical method further expands on this, positing that contradictions within a society, including those in moral and ethical frameworks, will eventually lead to synthesis and progress.

        "Knowledge, for Popper, was objective, both in the sense that it is objectively true (or truthlike), and also in the sense that it exists independently of any individual's subjective beliefs or feelings. Popper's philosophy of 'critical rationalism' posits that knowledge has the capacity to stand up to rigorous testing and scrutiny. This idea of objectivity relates closely to Popper's principle of falsification, which suggests that theories can never be absolutely confirmed, but can be invalidated by conflicting evidence.\n\nContrary to the traditional teaching that knowledge is a product of confirmed hypotheses, Popper argued that knowledge growth is driven by the elimination of error. Underpinning this perspective is the belief that humans cannot achieve absolute certainty, but we can asymptotically approach the truth through continual questioning and refinement of our theories. In Popper's view, knowledge is not about certainty, but about improving our understanding of reality. As such, true knowledge is dynamic, continually evolving, and always open to challenge.",

        "Vladimir had been prince of Novgorod when his father Sviatoslav I died in 972. He was forced to flee to Scandinavia due to political turmoil, only to return with a Viking fleet in 980, to claim Kyiv successfully from his brother Yaropolk. Thus, Vladimir the Great established himself as the ruler of a vast territory known as Kievan Rus. As a leader, he demonstrated an affinity towards political strategy and military prowess, but his lasting legacy lies in his conversion to Christianity. He introduced the Eastern Orthodox Church into Kievan Rus around 988, which marked a significant shift in the cultural and religious landscape of the region. This conversion was an influential move in helping shape the identity of the Slavic world. His reign brought about an era of monumental change, setting the foundation for the future Russian Orthodox Church. Even today, Vladimir is venerated as a saint in the Eastern Orthodox Church, where he is remembered as the Enlightener, symbolising his role in bringing Christianity to the Kievan Rus.",
        "Identity development is a stage in the adolescent life cycle. For most, the search for identity begins in the adolescent years. During these years, adolescents experience physical, psychological, and social changes that significantly influence their sense of self. They start to question their childhood beliefs and values, and seek to form their own independent identity.\n\nThis phase is characterized by exploration and experimentation in different areas such as religion, gender roles, political views, and career choices. Adolescents begin to grapple with questions like, \"Who am I?\" \"What do I believe in?\" \"What do I want to do with my life?\" These are critical questions that help them define their self-concept and personal identity.\n\nThe process of identity development can be challenging and filled with uncertainty. It is influenced by many factors such as peer pressure, family values, cultural expectations, and media. It is a journey that varies for each individual, with some finding their identity quicker than others. Despite the challenges, it is a crucial and necessary stage in the journey towards adulthood. Ultimately, the search for identity shapes the adolescent's future and forms the foundation of their adult personality",

His formative years were steeped in the teachings of these brave pioneers of faith, whose steadfast courage and resilience in the face of oppressive tyranny shaped his theological perspective and spiritual resolve. Through the tales of their trials, Athanasius learned the essence of devotion, the power of resilience, and the profound significance of martyrdom. Their stories painted vivid images of individuals who stood strong in their convictions, refusing to acquiesce to religious oppression and standing as living testaments of faith. These lessons instilled an indomitable spirit within Athanasius, that later became instrumental in his role as the Bishop of Alexandria. His unwavering commitment to the Nicene Creed, despite facing numerous exiles, reflected the influence of his early education with the martyrs. Thus, Athanasius illustrates the enduring legacy",
        "Egocentrism in adolescents forms a self-conscious desire to feel important in their peer groups and enjoy social acceptance. Unlike the conflicting aspects of adolescent egocentrism and personal fable, the desire for social acceptance can lead to conformity, a setback in the development of personal identity.\n\nAdolescence is a critical period where individuals begin to shape their identity, values, and beliefs. The egocentric tendency can skew this process as teenagers may suppress their personal thoughts to fit into social norms. They may adopt attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors prevalent within their peer group, even when they conflict with their true selves.\n\nThis desire for approval can lead to an overemphasis on external rather than internal validation, fostering an unhealthy dependency on others for self-worth. It is essential to educate adolescents about the difference between healthy social interactions and suppressing one's identity for acceptance. By doing so, we can help adolescents navigate this crucial stage of development and foster a healthy sense of self that goes beyond social acceptance.",
        "Stanley Schachter formulated his theory on the earlier work of a Spanish physician, Gregorio Mara\u00f1\u00f3n, who injected patients with adrenaline and observed their emotional response. These experiments led to Mara\u00f1\u00f3n's conclusion that physiological arousal precedes and indeed, determines emotional experience. Inspired by this, Schachter went further to propose his Two-Factor Theory of Emotion. \n\nAccording to Schachter, emotional experience is a function of both physiological arousal and cognitive interpretation of that arousal. In other words, when an individual experiences a physiological response (such as an increased heart rate or sweating), they must identify a reason for this response in order to experience and label it as an emotion. \n\nSchachter's theory was groundbreaking because it suggested that the physical and cognitive responses in emotion are interdependent, rather than sequential. It implies that our understanding and interpretation of a situation affects our emotional response, highlighting the importance of perception in emotional experience.",

        "Y DNA studies tend to imply a small number of founders in an old population whose members parted and followed different migration paths. In most Jewish populations, these findings have been particularly striking. The shared genetic markers among Jewish men across different regions indicate a common ancestry, tracing back to a small group of male ancestors. This provides compelling evidence of the Jewish diaspora - the dispersion of Jews beyond Israel - and supports the historical and biblical accounts of their migration. \n\nWhat\u2019s even more fascinating is the high degree of genetic similarity among Ashkenazi Jews, who make up approximately 80% of the global Jewish population. These similarities suggest a small number of founding members in the Ashkenazi Jewish population, further reinforcing the theory of a limited number of original Jewish patriarchs. Consequently, Y DNA studies provide an invaluable tool for understanding the complex tapestry of Jewish genetics, lineage, and history.",

Age is a critical determinant as younger and older individuals often exhibit weaker immune responses due to an immature or weakened immune system respectively. The nature of the antigen also matters; some are more potent than others, leading to varied immune responses. Maternal factors come into play because a pregnant woman can pass antibodies to her child, providing early life immune protection. Lastly, the body's response varies depending on the site of antigen presentation. For instance, skin-based reactions may trigger a swift local immune response, while internal invasions might require a systemic immune response. Understanding these factors is crucial for effective vaccine development and disease treatment strategies. Through this knowledge, we can tailor interventions to bolster the immune response against various antigens, thus enhancing health outcomes.",

The absence of a comprehensive judicial structure bred corruption, promoting a sense of lawlessness that was exploited by power-hungry nobles and opportunistic criminals alike, thus sparking civil unrest. The social fabric of the kingdom was effectively torn asunder by this conflict, with its citizens divided by their support for various factions vying for power. \n\nThe Guerras Civiles also exposed the inherent weaknesses in a feudal system where loyalty is often determined by the promise of wealth and power rather than a sense of duty to the kingdom. This led to an endless cycle of betrayal and retribution, further fuelling the conflict. \n\nThe chaotic state of the kingdom during the Guerras Civiles underlines the importance of an effective, transparent judicial system in maintaining social stability and preventing such destructive conflicts. As history showed, the lack of such a system had dire consequences.",
        "Terry Eastland, the author who wrote From Ending Affirmative Action: The Case for Colorblind Justice states, \"Most arguments for affirmative action fall into two categories: remediation of past wrongs and the diversity that purportedly comes with racial preferences.\" Eastland challenges the commonly held belief that affirmative action promotes diversity and remedies systemic injustices, instead suggesting it perpetuates discrimination.\n\nEastland contends that advancing racial preferences under the banner of affirmative action, glosses over the core issue of individual merit. He argues that society should focus on providing equal opportunities rather than giving preferences based on race or ethnicity. His philosophy aligns with the colorblind justice perspective, which calls for equal treatment of all individuals, regardless of their racial or ethnic background.\n\nEastland's work is a controversial yet insightful critique of affirmative action, shedding light on its potential pitfalls and advocating for a society that values individual merit over racial or ethnic identity. His perspective invites readers to re-evaluate their understanding of affirmative action and its longstanding",

        "The early and mid-1980s saw economic trouble for Libya; from 1982 to 1986, the country's annual oil revenues dropped from $21 billion to a meagre $5.4 billion. This financial calamity was primarily a result of shrinking global oil prices, coupled with the U.S-imposed economic sanctions that severely hit the Libyan economy. The sanctions, signed into law by President Reagan in 1986, were put in place in response to Libya's active involvement in international terrorism. The impact of these events was profound and widespread. It led to severe inflation, a sharp decline in the standard of living, and rampant unemployment. The government was forced to take drastic measures such as cutting public expenditure, devaluing the currency, and encouraging the private sector. Despite these efforts, the economic turmoil had long-lasting effects on Libya's socio-political structure and continues to shape its economy, even in the modern era.",

        "From his diagrams of a small number of particles interacting in spacetime, Feynman could then model all of physics in terms of the spins of particles, thereby revolutionizing our comprehension of the universe's fundamental processes. Richard Feynman, a prominent physicist of the 20th century, introduced a simpler, more visual way to understand particle interactions within quantum field theory - the Feynman diagrams. \n\nThese diagrams depict particles' spins, their fundamental property, as arrows, effectively visualizing their behavior during interactions. Feynman's interpretation greatly facilitated understanding the dynamics of subatomic particles and transformed our perception of the quantum world. It also served as a crucial tool in developing quantum electrodynamics, for which Feynman was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1965.\n\nFeynman's idea of representing physics in terms of spins of particles was indeed a groundbreaking advance. His diagrams not only simplified intricate concepts but also opened the door for further explorations into the very fabric of the",

This powerful fortress, sitting atop a limestone cliff overlooking the Seine River, was built by Richard the Lionheart in the late 12th century as a bulwark against French aggression. King John of England, Richard's brother, was now tasked with its defense. The castle was under siege by Philip II, the King of France, who sought to weaken English power in the region.\n\nDespite the formidable defenses of Ch\u00e2teau Gaillard, John's attempts to lift the siege were unsuccessful. His military expeditions were plagued by poor strategy, lack of manpower, and a critical shortage of supplies. The efforts were further hampered by internal strife within his ranks and wavering loyalties among his Norman allies.\n\nIn 1204, after a prolonged siege, Philip II successfully captured Ch\u00e2teau Gaillard.

        "In 2013, however, a study of Ashkenazi mitochondrial DNA by a team led by Martin B. Richards of the University of Huddersfield unveiled a new dimension of understanding about the Ashkenazi Jewish lineage. This pioneering research contradicted the prevailing theory that Ashkenazi Jews primarily descended from the Middle East, suggesting instead a significant European maternal lineage.\n\nThe Ashkenazi Jews, who primarily settled in Central and Eastern Europe, represent the largest Jewish ethnic division globally, and their ancestry's origin has been hypothesized and debated for years. Richards' team, using advanced DNA sequencing methods, analyzed the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) - genetic information passed on maternally - of over 3,500 individuals.\n\nThe results were startling. About 80% of Ashkenazi mtDNA revealed traces not from the Middle East, but from prehistoric Europe. This suggested that Jewish men from the Middle East migrated to Europe around 2,000 years ago and married local women who converted to Judaism.\n\nThis study, therefore, unveils a complex tapestry of Jewish ancestry, prompting us to reassess the intricate interplay of",
        "At the 1912 Salon d'Automne an architectural installation was exhibited that quickly became known as Maison Cubiste (Cubist House), signed Raymond Duchamp-Villon. The Maison Cubiste was not just an architectural model but a revolution in the realm of architecture that challenged traditional aesthetic notions. Duchamp-Villon's Cubist House was an embodiment of the Cubist movement's principles, upholding geometric simplicity and abstraction.\n\nThe installation, consisting of a facade and two rooms, was a radical departure from conventional architectural designs of the time. It was structured with simple geometric forms, stripped of decorative embellishments, thus reflecting the essence of Cubism, which was all about reducing objects to their basic geometric constituents. The interior was designed by Mare and was complete with Cubist sculptures and paintings. \n\nThis avant-garde work attracted widespread attention, causing both praise and indignation among critics and the public. The Cubist House marked a pivotal moment in 20th-century architecture, opening the door to the modernist architectural movements that dominated the rest of the century. Today, Maison Cubiste remains an iconic representation of Cubist architecture, demonstrating the power",
        "Some rock musicians today use mandolins, often single-stringed electric models rather than double-stringed acoustic mandolins. One example is Chris Thile, an American mandolin virtuoso known for his work in the progressive acoustic trio Nickel Creek and the bluegrass band Punch Brothers. Thile is an innovative musician who pushes the boundaries of the mandolin's versatility, incorporating it into various genres, including rock. \n\nSimilarly, Led Zeppelin's John Paul Jones is known for his use of electric mandolin in their iconic song \"The Battle of Evermore.\" Not only does the mandolin provide a unique tonal quality, but it also adds a distinctive texture to the soundscape of rock music. \n\nIn conclusion, the incorporation of the mandolin in rock music showcases the genre's openness to exploring various timbres and expanding its musical language. It is a testament to rock's continual evolution and adaptability, embracing an instrument traditionally associated with folk and bluegrass music.",
        "President Truman, symbolizing a broad-based desire for an Eisenhower candidacy for president, again in 1951 pressed him to run for the office as a Democrat. President Truman was a staunch believer in Eisenhower's leadership capabilities \u2013 a belief that transcended party lines. Truman saw in Eisenhower, a war hero and the then Supreme Commander of the NATO, a unifying figure who could bridge the chasms of political, social, and racial divides plaguing the nation. The President's unorthodox overture underscored his conviction that Eisenhower was the nation's best hope for stability, peace, and progress.\n\nEisenhower, however, initially declined. Despite his hesitance, Truman persistently urged him to reconsider. Truman's advocacy for Eisenhower was indicative of his genuine concern for the nation's welfare; it reflected his willingness to forgo partisan politics for the greater good. Ultimately, Eisenhower did run for presidency, not as a Democrat, but as a Republican, winning the election in 1952. Truman's gesture, though unconventional, stands as a testament to his ethos of putting national interest above party politics. His advocacy of Eisenhower reaffirms",

He was ordered into banishment to Beroea, a town in Thrace, as his steadfast refusal to partake in the condemnation of Athanasius and subscribe to the Arian faith was deemed non-compliant with imperial orders. Constantius, a zealous supporter of Arianism, found Liberius's steadfastness to Nicene orthodoxy a challenge to his quest of religious unity in the empire. This confrontation marked a critical point in the conflict between the Arian and Nicene factions of the Christian Church, highlighting the growing political power of the ecclesiastical structure. The exile of Liberius was perceived as an assertion of imperial power, however, it further alienated the supporters of Nicene Christianity. The banishment spurred antagonism against Arianism, strengthening the resolve of Nicene followers. Thus, the exile of Liberius served not only as a religious conflict but also as a significant political event in the broader context of the Roman Empire.",
        "The Montana Territory was formed on April 26, 1864, when the U.S. passed the Organic Act. Schools started forming in the area almost immediately, as the population began to grow and families made their homes in the newly formed territory. Education was of paramount importance to the early settlers, and they took measures to ensure their children received a proper education. One-room schoolhouses popped up across the territory, often serving multiple functions as community centers and meeting places. Notably, the first public school was established in Virginia City in 1866.\n\nThe curriculum in these schools was basic, focusing on reading, writing, and arithmetic. Teachers, often young, unmarried women, faced a daunting task of educating children of all ages and grades in one room. Despite the challenges, they persevered, laying the groundwork for the education system we see in Montana today. Their efforts were a testament to the value placed on education in the early days of Montana's history, a tradition that continues to this day",

        "The result was a sequence of innovative but unpopular financial measures. John levied scutage payments eleven times in his seventeen years as the King of England. These measures were radical, as they were implemented in a time when monarchs primarily relied on feudal dues to fund their activities. Scutage was essentially a form of taxation that allowed knights to opt out of their military duties by paying a fee. This system, while innovative, was deeply unpopular among the barons and knights who were forced to bear its brunt.\n\nJohn's persistent use of scutage was seen as a stark departure from traditional norms, sparking widespread discontent. The levy was not only viewed as a financial burden but also as an emblem of John's exploitative rule. The King's insistence on enforcing these measures, regardless of their unpopularity, played a significant role in the erosion of his support among the nobility. This ultimately led to the signing of the Magna Carta, a charter of rights designed to limit the",

Over two nights, the town was reduced to rubble, leaving a ghostly, almost lunar landscape. The relentless bombing crippled the town's infrastructure, decimating factories, schools, shops, and hospitals. The blitz was aimed at crippling Clydebank's industrial heart, specifically its ship-building and munitions factories. Miraculously, despite the magnitude of destruction, the spirit of the Clydebank community remained unbroken.

        "Although people often think that memory operates like recording equipment, it is not the case. The molecular mechanisms underlying the induction and maintenance of memory are very complex and dynamic. These mechanisms, unlike a static recording, are influenced by a variety of factors, ranging from the neurological to the environmental.\n\nAt the neurological level, memory is a product of synaptic plasticity - the ability of synapses to strengthen or weaken over time. This synaptic modification is carried out through a variety of processes, including long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD). Additionally, the induction and maintenance of memory engage multiple molecular pathways and a host of proteins.\n\nOn the environmental level, experiences, stress levels, and even diet can impact memory function.

        "Following the fall of Wu and the turmoil of the Wu Hu uprising against the Jin dynasty (265\u2013420), most of elite Chinese families had collaborated with the northern foreign invaders and ruled over the majority Han Chinese population. This period, historically known as the Sixteen Kingdoms era, was marked by repeated power struggles and territorial conflicts among the ruling elites.\n\nThese collaborating families adopted a pragmatic approach to maintain their power and influence. Many began to intermarry with the northern tribes, combining their sophisticated Chinese administrative skills with the military prowess of the invaders. This fusion fostered a unique hybrid culture that greatly influenced the development of Chinese civilization.\n\nHowever, this era was also marked by sustained societal chaos and economic decline. The continuous warfare led to population loss and displacement, disrupting agriculture and trade. Nevertheless, amidst these hardships, the resilient Chinese culture persevered, laying the foundation for the eventual reunification under the Sui and Tang dynasties. The legacy of this tumultuous period continues to be felt in Chinese",
        "A common way in which emotions are conceptualized in sociology is in terms of the multidimensional characteristics including cultural or emotional labels. These provide a framework to understand the nature of human emotions and how they navigate in societal contexts. For instance, the emotional labels like 'anger', 'joy', 'sadness' do not merely signify a private, internal state of being but are deeply embedded in cultural and social norms. \n\nDifferent cultures may have different labels and expressions for the same emotional experience. These labels, therefore, can influence how individuals perceive, interpret, and respond to emotional situations. They also serve as a societal tool in establishing norms for emotional expression, and thus, aid in maintaining social order. \n\nIn this schema, the interplay of individual emotions and societal norms is crucial. Exploring these can provide valuable insights on how emotions are shaped, expressed, or suppressed within a cultural context. This forms a key understanding in the sociological study of human emotions.",

Since a conservative body like the Republican Party and a liberal one such as the Democratic Party began to dominate the political landscape, smaller parties have struggled to gain significant traction. The Republicans and Democrats have set the stage for the discourse of American politics, encapsulating contrasting views on key issues. Republicans, traditionally, favor a limited role of government in economic activities and uphold conservative social values. Democrats, on the other hand, promote social equality, environmental protection, and advocate for government intervention in the economy to achieve these goals.\n\nThe existence of this two-party system, however, has invited criticism. Many argue that it restricts voter choice and stunts political innovation. Regardless, it has proven to be resilient and continues to shape U.S. politics. The future might bring changes, but for now, the two-party system is firmly rooted in the American political culture.",
        "Darwin was hard at work on his \"big book\" on Natural Selection, when on 18 June 1858 he received a parcel from Wallace, another naturalist who was conducting his own research in the Malay Archipelago. This parcel contained Wallace's essay titled \"On the Tendency of Varieties to Depart Indefinitely from the Original Type\". This manuscript outlined Wallace's independently conceived theory of natural selection, eerily similar to what Darwin had been meticulously working on for over 20 years.\n\nThe parcel presented a dilemma to Darwin. Should he abandon his yet-to-be-completed work, or rush to publish it? Ultimately, friends convinced him to present a joint paper to the Linnean Society, which included extracts from Darwin's 1844 essay, a letter to Asa Gray, and Wallace\u2019s paper. This event marked a crucial landmark in the history of evolutionary biology, when two independent minds converged on the same revolutionary idea, changing our understanding of the natural world forever.",
        "Early Modern universities initially continued the curriculum and research of the Middle Ages: natural philosophy, logic, medicine, theology, mathematics, astronomy (and astrology), law, grammar and rhetoric. Their primary focus was on the seven liberal arts \u2013 the trivium (grammar, rhetoric, and logic) and the quadrivium (arithmetic, geometry, music, and astronomy). \nHowever, over time, there was a significant shift in the curriculum. The Renaissance period brought forth an explosion of new ideas and philosophies that began to permeate these institutions. Scholars such as Copernicus, Galileo, and Newton challenged the Aristotelian worldview, fostering a new scientific outlook which was increasingly included in the university studies. \n\nIn addition to the natural sciences, other disciplines like history and the humanities gained prominence. The universities also began to reorient themselves towards serving the state, leading to an increased emphasis on disciplines such as law and medicine. \n\nBy the end of the Early Modern period, universities had broadened from their medieval roots to become the diverse, multifaceted institutions we recognize today, instrumental in the creation and dissemination of knowledge across",
        "The two major types of nonprofit organization are membership and board-only. A membership organization elects the board and has regular meetings and the power to amend the governance policies. These organizations include professional associations, trade unions, and cooperatives. The members are the key decision-makers and actively involved in shaping the organization's vision and strategies. \n\nOn the other hand, a board-only nonprofit organization is governed by a small group of individuals known as the board of directors, who carry the responsibility of decision-making. These individuals are generally chosen for their expertise or reputation in the community. They set the organization's strategic direction, manage financial resources, and establish operational policies. Common examples of board-only nonprofits are private foundations, hospitals, and universities. \n\nWhile both types have their advantages and disadvantages, the key to a successful nonprofit lies in its ability to engage its stakeholders, be it members or board directors, in its mission and activities, ensuring transparency, accountability, and effectiveness in its operations.",

They even established a major military base in Sicily, which became a strategic stronghold to repel any impending invasions. The Roman Senate, recognizing the escalating threat from the barbarian tribes, authorized the release of a vast amount of resources for the strengthening of its legions. This strategic move was not only to fortify its borders but also to assert its military prowess to potential adversaries.\n\nThe Roman military machine was famed for its discipline, organization, and efficiency. This was evident in their rapid response in the face of potential danger. Swift alterations in the positioning of their troops and the redirection of their resources showed their administrative competence and military strategy. The Roman approach to defense, characterized by a combination of tactical foresight and strategic flexibility, played a significant role in the longevity and influence of the Roman Empire. The Romans' strategic response to threats ensured their survival and left a lasting legacy",
        "Formal discipline is administered by congregation elders. When a baptized member is accused of committing a serious sin\u2014usually cases of sexual misconduct or charges of apostasy\u2014the elders meet with the accused individual in a judicial committee. This committee, comprised of at least three congregation elders, employs a standard yet comprehensive process to assess accusations. \n\nThe accused member is interrogated about the alleged transgressions, ensuring that all parties involved are given the chance to present their case. The goal is not to punish, but to rehabilitate and guide the individual towards repentance. If the accused party fails to express remorse or continues in their misconduct, the congregation may enforce disfellowshipping. This can result in social shunning by the community until the individual shows genuine repentance. \n\nAlthough this process may seem harsh, it is intended to preserve the spiritual purity of the congregation and encourage individuals to uphold the community's moral standards.",
        "Many cultures define the transition into adultlike sexuality by specific biological or social milestones in an adolescent's life. For example, menarche (the first occurrence of menstruation) in girls and the first ejaculation in boys are often considered pivotal moments of growing up. \n\nThese biological markers of puberty are widely acknowledged as the first steps into sexual maturity, marking the shift from childhood to adulthood. Apart from these natural milestones, there are also a myriad of societal markers that define this transition. These include religious ceremonies such as the Jewish Bar Mitzvah or Bat Mitzvah, or Latin American Quinceaneras, which publicly acknowledge the transition into adulthood. \n\nIn many societies, sexual education in schools also plays a significant role in the transition into adult sexuality. These programs are designed to impart knowledge about sexual health, relationships, and reproductive rights, shaping an adolescent's understanding of their own sexuality. Overall, the transition into adultlike sexuality is a multifaceted process, combining both biological and societal",

This honorific title is bestowed upon Hidalgo due to his decisive role in sparking the revolutionary spirit in Mexico. Hidalgo, a Roman Catholic priest, is best known for issuing the Grito de Dolores, a call to arms that triggered the Mexican War of Independence in 1810. His passionate plea for revolt against the Spanish colonial government ignited a fervor in the hearts of Mexicans that was instrumental in their eventual struggle for sovereignty. Iturbide, on the other hand, a royalist officer, turned insurgent, concluded this fight for freedom in 1821. But, despite his significant role, it's Hidalgo's initial rallying cry that resonates deeply with Mexicans and has earned him the title of Father of the Nation.

        "Although the doctrine of Mary's Immaculate Conception appears only later among Latin (and particularly Frankish) theologians, it became ever more popular as time went on. The doctrine espouses that Mary, the mother of Jesus, was conceived without original sin, a unique privilege granted by God. This belief was not universally accepted at first, sparking intricate theological debates that stretched across centuries. \n\nEarly objections were rooted in the understanding of original sin and human conception. However, the doctrine gradually gained ground, finding supporters among influential theologians and church leaders. This can be attributed to the increasing emphasis on Mary's purity and holiness, which made her a suitable vessel for the incarnation of Christ. \n\nThe doctrine was finally defined as a dogma by Pope Pius IX in 1854, cementing its place in the Catholic faith. Today, the Immaculate Conception remains a significant aspect of Marian doctrine and devotion, celebrated annually on December 8th, indicating the enduring influence of this",

        "Comprehensive schools have been accused of grade inflation after a study revealed that Gymnasium senior students of average mathematical ability found themselves at the very bottom of their classes. The phenomenon, often termed 'grade inflation,' is essentially the practice of awarding higher grades than students may deserve, which can create a skewed representation of true academic ability. Critics argue that this practice devalues educational credentials and falsifies a student's true comprehension and application of the subject matter. This recent study conducted across a spectrum of comprehensive schools found that average-performing Gymnasium students ranked lower in their class compared to their counterparts in comprehensive schools. This discrepancy illuminates a potential over-estimation of student performance within comprehensive schools. It raises questions around the consistency of academic standards across the educational system and the impact on students' future prospects. The findings underline the urgent need for a robust, fair, and standardised national grading system to ensure transparency and integrity in comparing students' academic performance.",
        "The university culture developed differently in northern Europe than it did in the south, although the northern (primarily Germany, France and Great Britain) and southern (mainly Italy and Spain) regions both contributed significantly to the development of modern academia. In the north, universities evolved from monastic schools and stressed a broad education based on liberal arts. Their focus on research, innovation, and academic freedom fostered an environment conducive to critical thinking and scientific advancement.\n\nIn contrast, southern universities, many of which were born out of cathedral schools, emphasized a more rigid curriculum heavily influenced by the Scholasticism, which was deeply entrenched in religious doctrine. Their major emphasis was on maintaining tradition and adhering to established knowledge.\n\nThe bifurcation, however, enriched the European academic landscape by promoting a balance between the preservation of traditional knowledge and the pursuit of new ideas. Today, the influence of both traditions can be seen in universities across the world, underscoring their collective impact on global education.",
        "The Yale Report of 1828 was a dogmatic defense of the Latin and Greek curriculum against critics who wanted more courses in modern languages, mathematics, and science. This report, commissioned by the Yale faculty, struck a resonating chord across the Ivy League institutions, reiterating the importance of a classical education even in an increasingly modern world. The faculty argued that education should not merely be a means of preparing for a professional career, but rather an avenue for holistic intellectual development. They believed that classical languages, with their rich literary heritage and complex grammatical structures, could mold young minds better than any newly emerging subjects. Furthermore, they stressed that these classical studies cultivated a mental discipline, a faculty of critical analysis, and an appreciation for the timeless values of Western civilization. This report was, in many ways, a powerful reaffirmation of the traditional liberal arts curriculum, resisting the onslaught of an increasingly utilitarian conception of education in the 19th century.",
        "Flexible or so-called \"unbreakable\" records made of unusual materials were introduced by a number of manufacturers at various times during the golden age of record production. The goal was to create a record that could withstand the rigors of heavy use and transportation without the risk of being damaged or broken. These records were made from materials such as plastic, cardboard, and even aluminum foil.\n\nOne of the most notable examples was the introduction of the vinyl record by RCA Victor in 1948. This record was made from PVC plastic, which was both durable and flexible. PVC records were also superior in terms of sound quality, making them an instant hit with consumers.\n\nAnother interesting example was the cardboard record. In the 1950s, cereal companies would often include these records as a free gift in their products. While the sound quality was poor compared to vinyl, the novelty of a record made from cardboard was enough to make them popular.\n\nLastly, there were the aluminum foil records.

        "Microbiological culture is a principal tool used to diagnose infectious disease. In a microbial culture, a growth medium is provided for a specific agent. The growth medium is a substance, usually a gel or a liquid, that provides the nutrients required for microbes to reproduce. It is purposefully designed to favor the growth of specific microorganisms while inhibiting the growth of others. \n\nOnce the sample is placed in the growth medium, it is incubated in a controlled environment that encourages microbial growth. Upon sufficient growth, the microorganisms are then identified based on their visual characteristics, resistance to antibiotics, or specific molecular tests. This identification process helps determine the cause of the infection and the most effective treatment.\n\nMicrobiological cultures are critical in the medical field, not only in diagnosing infectious diseases but also in understanding the pathogenesis of diseases and researching potential treatments.

Many traditions came together, reflecting a diverse blend of influences from pagan rituals, Christian traditions, and popular folklore. The Carnival season, often associated with wild revelry and indulgence, provided a socially sanctioned outlet for celebration and satire in a period of intense religious piety. \n\nCarnival's anarchic spirit challenged societal norms, with participants often donning disguises or masks, allowing them to embody different personas or engage in behaviors typically considered taboo. It was a time of reversal, where power hierarchies were subverted, and the ordinary rules of daily life suspended. \n\nDespite its seemingly raucous nature, Carnival played a crucial role in medieval society by offering a safety valve for social tensions, reinforcing community bonds and allowing individuals to express dissent or discontent.

Young children tend to assert themselves forcefully, but are unable to demonstrate much influence over family decisions until early adolescence. During this transformative period, teenagers start to shape their identities and hone their unique skills and abilities.\n\nThis phase of life is synonymous with rebellion, questioning norms and rules, and asserting independence. Adolescents start to form their opinions and start to challenge parental authority, which can cause familial discord. However, this should not be viewed negatively, as it is an essential part of their growth and self-discovery.\n\nAdolescence leads to a stronger sense of individuality and an increased attention to social interaction. It sets the stage for constructive dialogues and open conversations within the family, fostering mutual respect.

In May 1987, Gaddafi introduced a new economic system known as \"Jamahiriya,\" which aimed to distribute wealth amongst the population and reduce the gap between the rich and the poor. This unique approach to socialist economics saw the abolishment of old bureaucratic systems, replaced instead with 'People's Committees' and 'People's Congresses', effectively decentralising power and giving some to the general public.\n\nThese reforms also included measures to liberalise the economy.

The formation of this province, nestled in the Western Himalayas, marked a significant shift in India's political landscape. The 28 states were primarily small hill kingdoms, with varying degrees of autonomy, but under the subjugation of the British Empire. Post-independence, these states were integrated to form a centrally administered area, which later became the Union Territory of Himachal Pradesh in 1956. This integration not only brought political and administrative coherence but also facilitated socioeconomic development and unity among the diverse cultural entities of the region.

        "Homer refers to the \"Hellenes\" (/\u02c8h\u025bli\u02d0nz/) as a relatively small tribe settled in the Thessalian regions of Phthia in Central Greece. The Hellenes distinguished themselves in the ancient world as pioneers of an innovative, organized civilization. This society, regarded as the genesis of classical Greek civilization, was not a mere assembly of primitive tribespeople, but a complex, advanced collective of intellectuals, warriors, philosophers, and artists. The Hellenes played an influential role in shaping Greek mythology, language, and culture, their contributions echoing through the centuries. They were known for their mastery in various fields such as philosophy, the arts, and warfare. The term \"Hellenes\" eventually expanded to include all inhabitants of the Hellenic city-states, signifying the unity and shared identity of the Greek people. Homer's depiction of the Hellenes emphasizes their significance in the formation of one of the most influential civilizations in human history.",
        "Initially, the Turkish Cypriots favoured the continuation of the British rule. However, they were alarmed by the Greek Cypriot calls for Enosis, the union of Cyprus with Greece. This politically loaded proposition struck fear into the hearts of Turkish Cypriots. They interpreted it as an existential threat to their identity, culture, and political rights, triggering the demand for Taksim, or partition. This was a plea for a separate political entity entirely, carving out a space for Turkish Cypriots distinct from their Greek counterparts. \n\nThe tension between Enosis and Taksim led to a period of ethnic conflict and political turmoil in the mid-20th Century. The United Nations intervened, but peace remained elusive. The fractious relationship between the Greek and Turkish Cypriots remains a complex issue, symbolising the ongoing potency of nationalist aspirations and the enduring influence of past colonial divisions.

However, the battle was one-sided almost from the beginning. The reasons for this are the subject of continuing study by military strategists and historians. The imbalance may be traced back to several key factors including the disparity in numbers, superior military technology, and strategic positioning. \n\nMany argue that the dominant force\u2019s numerical advantage played a significant role. Indeed, large armies have a precedent for overwhelming their enemies regardless of the individual soldier's skill. Simultaneously, superior military technology can turn the tide of any battle. The advent of new weaponry or tactics can render an enemy defenseless, often leading to a swift and decisive victory.\n\nLastly, the strategic positioning of troops is pivotal. A well-positioned army can utilize the terrain to its advantage, reducing the opponent's ability to maneuver and increasing their vulnerability. This combination of factors often results in one-sided battles that end before they truly begin, making them a fascinating area of study for military enthusiasts and historians.",
        "The European concept of \"race\", along with many of the ideas now associated with the term, arose at the time of the scientific revolution, which took place between the 15th and 16th centuries. During this period, Europeans began to categorise and classify humanity according to physical differences such as skin colour, hair texture, and facial features. It was an era marked by a shift from religious to secular explanations of the natural world, laying the foundation for the development of biological and racial taxonomy.\n\nNotably, the classification of humans into distinct 'races' was influenced by scientific discoveries, social prejudices and biases. The hierarchical ordering led to the construction of stereotypes, perpetuating racial discrimination and inequalities. It is crucial to understand that 'race' as a biological construct has been largely discredited; it's a socio-political construct informed more by cultural and societal norms than by science. Consequently, many contemporary scholars and scientists argue for the abandonment of 'race' as a significant biological classification. Ultimately",

Through peer interactions, adolescents learn skills such as compromise, negotiation, and empathy. Familial relationships, on the other hand, provide a foundation of stability, guidance, and support. Positive family relationships nurture self-esteem and foster resilience.\n\nInteractions within the broader social sphere, including with teachers, coaches, and mentors, can also significantly impact adolescents. These figures can serve as role models, teach valuable life skills, and instill a sense of responsibility and cultural identity. Thus, the relationships adolescents cultivate profoundly impact their development and overall adjustment to society.",
        "One hundred years after the fall of Constantinople in 1453, Pierre Belon described in his work Observations in 1553 that the landscape of the city had dramatically transformed. Notably, the Ottoman Empire's influence had significantly marked the city, evident in the towering minarets and grand mosques that had supplanted once-dominant Christian basilicas. Belon's chronicles reveal a city that had morphed from being the heart of the Byzantine Empire into the center of Islamic culture and learning. The bustling markets, rich with the aroma of spices, the sound of traders, and diverse products from the far reaches of the empire, portrayed a vibrant hub of commerce and exchange. Moreover, Belon observed that the Greek-Roman architecture of Constantinople had now been substituted with the intricate designs and characteristic domes of Ottoman architecture. His Observations serve as a poignant testament to the city's resilience and adaptability, embracing an entirely new identity while honoring its rich past.",
        "Most fatty acids are non-essential, meaning the body can produce them as needed, generally from other fatty acids and always by expending energy to do so. However, some fatty acids, known as essential fatty acids, cannot be synthesized by the body and must be obtained through the diet. These include omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids, which are crucial for brain function, cell growth and immune system support. Unlike non-essential fatty acids, the body cannot produce these essential nutrients on its own, hence the term \"essential.\" \n\nThese essential fatty acids are primarily found in fish, nuts, seeds and vegetable oils. They play a vital role in the production of hormones, promoting heart health, reducing inflammation, and supporting overall physical and mental well-being. Thus, our body's inability to produce these fatty acids necessitates their inclusion in our diet. Therefore, it is important to have a well-balanced diet that includes a variety of these essential fatty acids to ensure optimal health. Understanding the difference between essential and non-essential fatty acids can be key to making informed nutritional choices.",
        "In late 1975, Queen recorded and released A Night at the Opera, taking its name from the popular Marx Brothers movie. At the time, it was the most expensive album ever produced. The band spent a great deal of time and money on the album, experimenting with a range of multi-track recording techniques and overdubs. This outlay paid off handsomely, resulting in a groundbreaking album that showcased the band's wide-ranging talents and musical versatility.\n\nPerhaps the most famous song on the album is 'Bohemian Rhapsody', a mini-opera in itself, featuring multiple sections and changes in tempo and key. This ambitious number defied conventional song structure and yet became a massive international hit, demonstrating the band's uncanny knack for pushing boundaries while remaining accessible to the masses. \n\nThe album also featured 'You're My Best Friend', a warm, melodic pop tune penned by bassist John Deacon. A Night at the Opera was a critical and commercial success, solidifying Queen's status as rock music icons and setting a high standard for future rock operas.",
        "About 20% of pupils at Eton receive financial support, through a range of bursaries and scholarships. The recent Head Master, Tony Little, initiated several schemes aimed at broadening access to the prestigious institution, acknowledging the need for diversity among the student body. These include the New Foundation Scholarship, specifically designed to encourage talented boys from less privileged backgrounds to apply. Bursaries, ranging from 5% to 100% of fees, are available to families in varying circumstances. The Eton Foundation also offers a means-tested bursary scheme, which provides financial assistance to families who cannot afford the full fees. The scholarships, on the other hand, are merit-based awards, given to students who excel acadically, as well as in arts, sports and service. Despite being a bastion of privilege, Eton has recognized that talent is not confined to one socio-economic group and, through these initiatives, is making efforts to ensure that the benefits of an Eton education are more widely accessible.",
        "After its release, Evita garnered critical appreciation. Zach Conner from Time magazine commented, \"It's a relief to say that Evita is as invigorating as it is provocative. Madonna, in the titular role, delivers a performance that is nothing less than captivating. Her portrayal of Argentina's beloved First Lady, Eva Per\u00f3n, is both passionate and poignant, and she breathes life into the complex character with consummate skill.\n\nThe film's director, Alan Parker, has crafted a musical spectacle that balances grandeur with heartfelt emotion. The narrative unfolds with a well-paced rhythm, guided by the stirring melodies of Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice, which lends the film a compelling musicality. \n\nThe supporting cast, particularly Antonio Banderas, complements Madonna's performance and enhances the film\u2019s overall impact. Banderas, in his portrayal of Ch\u00e9, infuses the role with a dynamic charisma that is impossible to ignore. \n\nIn conclusion, Evita is a cinematic tour de force, a stirring blend of music, emotion, and political intrigue that continues to captivate audiences decades after its release. Its critical acclaim is",
        "During his life and especially in the first year after his death, several places were named after Tito. Several of these places have since returned to their original designations, reflecting the complex legacy of this prominent figure in Yugoslavia's 20th-century history.\n\nJosip Broz Tito, the charismatic and long-standing leader of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, was a figure who commanded great respect and adulation during his time. His death in 1980 sparked a wave of commemoration, and numerous public spaces, streets, and institutions were renamed in his honor. These included the Tito Barracks in Belgrade and the Tito Square in Ljubljana, among many others.\n\nHowever, after the breakup of Yugoslavia in the early 1990s, the sentiment towards Tito and his era significantly shifted in several successor states. As a result, many places that bore his name were rechristened. This trend reflects the changing attitudes towards Tito's rule, emphasizing the importance",
        "In the wake of the Coventry Blitz, there was widespread agitation from the Communist Party over the need for bomb-proof shelters. Many saw this as a crucial need for civilian protection, given the terrifying destruction that had been witnessed in Coventry and other major cities across the UK during the Blitz. They argued that the government's existing provision of air-raid shelters was insufficient, leaving civilians exposed to the devastating power of the bombs. Their campaign was intense, involving public rallies, newspaper articles, petitions, and lobbying of local and national politicians. They presented bomb-proof shelters not just as a practical measure, but also as a moral commitment to the protection of innocent lives. Despite facing opposition from those who saw such measures as excessive or impracticable, the Communist Party pressed on with their campaign. The controversy over bomb-proof shelters in the post-Blitz era serves as a stark reminder of the deep-seated fears and anxieties provoked by the war.",
        "Following the Sergeant Isaac Woodard incident, President Harry S. Truman, himself a combat veteran of World War I, issued Executive Order 9808 establishing the President's Committee on Civil Rights. The Woodard case, where a decorated African American soldier was brutally attacked and blinded by white policemen, shook the nation and sparked a public outcry for justice and equality. The Committee, created in 1946, was tasked with investigating the status of civil rights in the nation and proposing measures to strengthen and protect them. This marked a significant moment in American history as it represented a move towards a federal commitment to securing civil rights for all citizens. The Committee's work laid the foundation for the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965, landmark legislations that brought an end to racial segregation and secured voting rights for minorities. Truman's bold step underscored the need for national introspection and action to correct deep-seated racial injustices.",
        "Protestants also took the initiative in advocating for religious freedom. Freedom of conscience had high priority on the theological, philosophical, and political agendas since the inception of Protestantism in the 16th century. This was fundamentally rooted in the Protestant tenet of 'sola scriptura' or 'scripture alone,' asserting that an individual's faith should be guided solely by the Bible, independent of clerical interpretation or intervention. \n\nThis belief stimulated Protestant thought towards religious freedom, leading to a major shift in the relationship between the church and the state. Prominent Protestant thinkers like John Locke and Roger Williams were instrumental in advocating for the separation of church and state, paving the way for religious tolerance. \n\nThe Protestant advocacy for religious freedom became a cornerstone of democratic societies and was enshrined in the U.S. Constitution's First Amendment, an enduring testament to the influence of Protestantism on civil liberties. Thus, the Protestants' initiative in advocating religious freedom was not just a theological stance, but it",
        "In mainland China, the Japanese 3rd, 6th, and 40th Divisions massed at Yueyang and advanced southward in three columns, kicking off a significant period in the Sino-Japanese War. This strategic maneuver, undertaken in 1939, was a part of the larger Battle of Changsha; a crucial military campaign in the second Sino-Japanese War. \n\nThe Japanese forces, armed with superior weaponry and following exact orders, aimed to capture Changsha, a city of strategic importance due to its location on the Xiang river. The Japanese believed that seizing this city would provide them with a solid base for further incursions into the Chinese interior. \n\nHowever, the Chinese forces put up a fierce resistance, exhibiting remarkable tenacity and courage. Despite being outmatched in terms of weaponry and resources, they managed to halt the Japanese advancement, turning the tide of the war in their favor. The Battle of Changsha stands as a testament to the resilience and determination",

        "Critics labelled Gaddafi \"despotic, cruel, arrogant, vain and stupid\", with Western governments and press presenting him as the \"vicious dictator of Libya\". Indeed, his reign was characterized by widespread human rights abuses, economic mismanagement, and corruption. Gaddafi's unpredictability and flamboyant style endeared him to some, yet his ruthless suppression of dissent led to an environment of fear and repression. His reign was marked by the use of public executions, torture, and arbitrary detentions as tools of intimidation.\n\nMoreover, Gaddafi's obsession with power and disregard for democratic norms led to a significant decline in Libya's international reputation. His support for international terrorism and pursuit of weapons of mass destruction further alienated him from the global community. Gaddafi's downfall during the Arab Spring uprising was a testament to his failed leadership. The enduring legacy of his rule is a Libya still struggling to recover from the devastating impacts of his despotic reign, serving as a stark reminder of the perils",
        "Before the early 20th century, treatments for infections were based primarily on medicinal folklore. Mixtures with antimicrobial properties that were used in treatments of infections included honey, moldy bread, plant extracts, and various other natural substances. The first scientific approach to tackle infections came with the discovery of the antibiotic Penicillin by Alexander Fleming in 1928. This marked a significant turnaround in medical history, as it introduced a new age of antibiotics that could combat bacterial diseases efficiently. The discovery of antibiotics allowed for the treatment of previously incurable diseases like tuberculosis and pneumonia, and surgeries became less risky and more successful due to the decreased risk of postoperative infections. However, the overuse and misuse of antibiotics have led to the emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, posing a significant threat to global health. It's a stark reminder that while our medical knowledge has evolved, we must continue to use it responsibly and judiciously to preserve its effectiveness for future generations.",
        "A standard adult football match consists of two periods of 45 minutes each, known as halves. Each half runs continuously, meaning that the clock is not stopped when the ball is out of play. Instead, the referee adds on 'stoppage time' at the end of each half to account for any interruptions in play, such as fouls, injuries, or substitutions. The break between the two halves, known as halftime, is typically 15 minutes long. During this time, teams can regroup, discuss strategies, and make tactical changes. The aim of each team is to score more goals than the opponent within the stipulated 90 minutes. If the scores are equal at the end of the game, it may go into extra time or a penalty shootout, depending on the rules of the specific competition. Overall, a football match is a dynamic, strategic game that requires athleticism, teamwork, and quick decision-making skills."
