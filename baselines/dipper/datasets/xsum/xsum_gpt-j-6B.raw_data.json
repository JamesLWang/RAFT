Gareth Hicks, 24, suffered fatal injuries when the van he was asleep in was hit by Mr Scott's Audi A6. Maj Scott denies a charge of causing death by careless driving. Prosecutor Charles Gabb alleged the defendant, from Green Lane in Shepperton, Surrey, had crossed the carriageway of the 60mph-limit B390 in Shrewton near Amesbury. The weather was \"awful\" and there was strong wind and rain, he told jurors. He said Mr Scott's car was described as \"twitching\" and \"may have been aquaplaning\" before striking the first vehicle; a BMW driven",
        "The ban was backed by local authorities in Urumqi, state media reported. The move is the latest in a campaign against Islamic clothing and symbols in the mainly Muslim region. China's government has blamed Uighur militants for several recent attacks - but activists say the violence has been fuelled by Chinese repression. The Uighurs traditionally practice a moderate form of Islam. Recently, though, the influence of stricter forms of the faith from the Gulf and Pakistan has led to more women covering their faces. According to the BBC's Asia Pacific editor, Charles Scanlon, the Chinese authorities regard wearing an Islamic face veil as an act of defiance at a time of growing violence in the region. In August this year, the northern city of Karamay banned men with long beards from boarding buses. Some experts believe such restrictions could backfire at a time when many Uighurs believe their culture is under attack. James Leibold, an",

Horses are only allowed to receive hay-feed or water before a race, but other substances such as electrolytes are permitted post-race.

The dispute, which began in 2014 and centres around pay and weekend working, has led to strikes being held across England. The next is a 24-hour strike planned for Wednesday, when emergency care will only be provided from 08:00 GMT.

Massandra was Ukrainian government property before Russia's annexation of Crimea in March 2014. Any charges could not currently be pursued in Crimea, where Russia has full control. Russian media cited by Radio Free Europe reported that Berlusconi asked if he could sample the wine during a tour of Massandra. A witness said Massandra's new pro-Russian director Yanina Pavlenko in response uncorked a precious bottle of 1775 Jeres de la Frontera for her prestigious guests. Russian television last week showed Mr Berlusconi carefully surveying dust-covered bottles of wine while the Russian leader listened to Ms Pavlenko as she gave them the tour. Later, the Italian billionaire is seen looking at a bottle identified to be from the vintage of 1891, and asked in English: \"Is it possible to drink?\" The director replied:",

The Great British Bake Off, the Strictly Christmas special and Call the Midwife are also expected to create high demand over the Christmas period.

The Department of Health said the NHS couldn't afford the union's demands. The government has given NHS staff a 1% pay rise, but not for those who get automatic progression-in-the-job increases. Those increases are given to about half of staff and are worth 3% a year on average. The decision by ministers went against the recommendation of the independent pay review board, which called for an across-the-board rise. The Unison general secretary Dave Prentis said: \"NHS members don't take action often or lightly. \"For many of our members this will be the first time they",

Cryptoy also showcases the substitution and vigenere cyphers, and the shift, which dates back to Roman times. A spokeswoman for Cheltenham-based GCHQ said the app is intended as a \"fun teaching aid\" to help 14-16 year olds studying at the Key Stage 4 level learn something about code making and code breaking.

Having returned from loan spells from East Fife and Brechin respectively, Coote and Robson were not eligible to appear for United again until the start of next season.

The 55-year-old is the first military prisoner from Afghanistan to be tried in a US federal court. Some of the charges carry a mandatory life sentence. About 30 insurgents died in the attack, with Hamidullin the only survivor, while no American or Afghan soldiers were killed. Hamidullin, who did not testify during the trial, is expected to be sentenced on 6 November. Lawyers say it is unusual for someone captured on the battlefield in Afghanistan to be transferred to the United States for trial in a federal court. Hamidullin's defence lawyers had tried unsuccessfully to have the charges dismissed, saying their client was a prisoner of war and ineligible for trial in civilian court.

More than a million people were displaced. Mr Modi is the second Indian PM to visit Siachen. Manmohan Singh went there in 2005. More soldiers have died from harsh weather on the glacier than in combat since India seized control of it in 1984, narrowly pipping Pakistan.

        "Those with higher levels of emotional investment in social media, and who use it at night, were more likely to feel depressed and anxious, they say. Glasgow University researchers questioned 467 teenagers about their use of social media and state of mind. They found many felt a pressure to respond immediately to texts or posts. Lead researcher Dr Heather Cleland Woods and Holly Scott asked the teenagers about how and when they used social media. Sleep quality, self-esteem, anxiety, depression and the subjects' emotional investment in social media were also measured. This related to the pressure to be available 24/7 and any anxiety around, for example, not responding immediately to texts or posts.

It would mean current restrictions on industrial action in the NHS, the fire service, schools and other devolved services in Wales would change. UK ministers say industrial relations are a matter for Westminster. A key element of the UK government's law is to only allow strikes backed by 40% of a union's members in a ballot. But members of the Welsh Assembly's Equality, Local Government and Communities Committee agreed the new legislation was needed to maintain Wales' \"social-partnership\" approach.

Beijing has been building artificial islands on reefs in waters also claimed by other nations. Images published late last year show military defences on some islands, a think-tank says. Mr Tillerson, appearing before the US Senate Foreign Relations Committee, likened China's island-building to Russia's annexation of Crimea from Ukraine. \"We're going to have to send China a clear signal that first, the island-building stops and second, your access to those islands also is not going to be allowed.\" China's island-building has caused dismay in the region. Beijing claims almost all of the South China Sea, but Vietnam, the Philippines, Taiwan, Malaysia and Brunei all have competing claims. In July an international tribunal ruled against Chinese claims, backing a case brought by the Philippines, but Beijing said it would not respect the verdict.
