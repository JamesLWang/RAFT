        "Maj Richard Scott, 40, is accused of driving at speeds of up to 95mph (153km/h) in bad weather before the smash on a B-road in Wiltshire. Gareth Hicks, 24, suffered fatal injuries when the van he was asleep in was hit by Mr Scott's Audi A6. Maj Scott denies a charge of causing death by careless driving. Prosecutor Charles Gabb alleged the defendant, from Green Lane in Shepperton, Surrey, had crossed the carriageway of the 60mph-limit B390 in Shrewton near Amesbury. The weather was \"awful\" and there was strong wind and rain, he told jurors. He said Mr Scott's car was described as \"twitching\" and \"may have been aquaplaning\" before striking the first vehicle; a BMW driven by Craig Reed. Mr Scott's Audi then returned to his side of the road but crossed the carriageway again before colliding head-on with a Ford Transit van",
        "The ban was backed by local authorities in Urumqi, state media reported. The move is the latest in a campaign against Islamic clothing and symbols in the mainly Muslim region. China's government has blamed Uighur militants for several recent attacks - but activists say the violence has been fuelled by Chinese repression. The Uighurs traditionally practice a moderate form of Islam. Recently, though, the influence of stricter forms of the faith from the Gulf and Pakistan has led to more women covering their faces. According to the BBC's Asia Pacific editor, Charles Scanlon, the Chinese authorities regard wearing an Islamic face veil as an act of defiance at a time of growing violence in the region. In August this year, the northern city of Karamay banned men with long beards from boarding buses. Some experts believe such",

Horses are only allowed to receive hay-feed or water before a race, but other substances such as electrolytes are permitted post-race. Employees of Palmer and fellow trainers, Francois Rohaut and and Jean-Claude Rouget, as well as the trainers themselves, were interviewed by stewards following a report by the Equine Welfare and Integrity Officer. Palmer is yet to hear what punishment the BHA will hand down. \"I imagine there will be a routine fine for a rule that's been broken,\" he told BBC Radio Berkshire. \"There's no suggestion that anyone was trying to seek an advantage or cheat.",

But a disciplinary panel ruled contact with the pupil was probably made and her conduct had been \"unacceptable\". On Thursday, the Education Workforce Council imposed the suspension, saying: \"The public interest is in favour of her being able to teach again.\" Mrs Hungerford admitted shouting and slamming a book on the desk of the \"provocative and disruptive\" teenager as he listened to rap music in her classroom - but always denied hitting his head. She was cleared, on appeal, of a criminal charge for assaulting the pupil during a maths lesson for those with learning difficulties. But in November, a disciplinary panel found, on the balance of probabilities, she had made physical conduct with the pupil on the head or hand. The panel found she had \"acted in an inappropriate way\"",

She said:\"There are some who would say we have no right to remember or to honour them, we have absolutely every right. \"Everyone, it doesn't matter who you are, has the right to remember their dead in a respectful and dignified manner.\" The four IRA men were shot dead after attacking Coalisland police station.

Mr Hunt wants to change junior doctors' contracts, which he says are \"unfair\". The BMA said its door was open to talks and blamed the strikes on Mr Hunt's \"shambolic mishandling\" of the matter. The dispute, which began in 2014 and centres around pay and weekend working, has led to strikes being held across England. The next is a 24-hour strike planned for Wednesday, when emergency care will only be provided from 08:00 GMT. Asking by Marr about low morale among junior doctors, Mr Hunt said: \"One of the reasons for that anger is that they were told by the BMA that their pay was going to be cut - it isn't. \"They were told that they were going to be asked to work longer hours",

Savings from the proposal would be invested in making more staff available to crew Fire Rescue Units. But the Fire Brigades Union (FBU) said it would be \"dangerous and reckless\" to get rid of them permanently. The London Fire Brigade (LFB) has released three plans to make the savings. It insists no stations will close and no firefighters will be forced to leave their jobs. The Brigade said it had continued to meet London-wide attendance time targets while the 13 engines had been out of service. It said that bringing them back would improve response times by about four seconds for the first engine to reach the scene. An alternative proposal has been put forward by London Assembly Member Andrew Dismore, who recommends putting the 13 fire engines back into service but making savings",

AP said later: \"The @AP twitter account has been hacked. The tweet about an attack at the White House is false.\" The account was back online on Wednesday.

At the event on Thursday, Mr Carney said that in theory capital should flow from advanced to emerging economies due to high returns. In practice, however, the opposite has happened - and this has driven down bond yields in advanced economies, he said. When money has sporadically flowed to emerging economies it has had a destabilising influence, he said. \"In this context, green finance is a major opportunity.

The Department of Health said the NHS couldn't afford the union's demands. The government has given NHS staff a 1% pay rise, but not for those who get automatic progression-in-the-job increases. Those increases are given to about half of staff and are worth 3% a year on average.

The 55-year-old is the first military prisoner from Afghanistan to be tried in a US federal court. Some of the charges carry a mandatory life sentence. About 30 insurgents died in the attack, with Hamidullin the only survivor, while no American or Afghan soldiers were killed. Hamidullin, who did not testify during the trial, is expected to be sentenced on 6 November. Lawyers say it is unusual for someone captured on the battlefield in Afghanistan to be transferred to the United States for trial in a federal court.

It described the culture as \"pseudo-militaristic\", with \"an unhealthy leaning towards punitive discipline\". The PSNI accepted 50 recommended changes. Chief Constable George Hamilton and other members of the senior PSNI members will meet members of the Policing Board to discuss an implementation plan to address concerns raised. A number of changes to the 22-week training course were introduced immediately.

Their job is mainly about auditing the use of detonators - how many have been used, have the excess detonators been disposed off etc. This is something that has been happening for 40-plus years. But a typical quarry blast would only happen about twice a month. In a gold mine, explosives use is much more intense - blasting happens three or four times a week.

Glasgow University researchers questioned 467 teenagers about their use of social media and state of mind. They found many felt a pressure to respond immediately to texts or posts. Lead researcher Dr Heather Cleland Woods and Holly Scott asked the teenagers about how and when they used social media. Sleep quality, self-esteem, anxiety, depression and the subjects' emotional investment in social media were also measured. This related to the pressure to be available 24/7 and any anxiety around, for example, not responding immediately to texts or posts.

        "The \"loneliness maps\" could be used to target limited resources at the people and places that need them most. The Hidden Citizens report, published by the Invisible Institute and the Open Technology Institute, looked at anonymized government data on more than 300 million users from the US Department of Veterans Affairs and found that those veterans suffering most from the biggest social problems are often often those most alone. The project's report also highlights the fact that people who appear most isolated aren't necessarily the most vulnerable to loneliness: there were no \"loneliness maps\" for people who had recently lost someone close to them.\n\n\"We know that there are a lot of reasons people don't feel they're getting the support they need. A lot of those reasons are connected to issues of isolation or loneliness,\" said David Amodio, who co-authored the Hidden Citizens report with Jason Hall, a Harvard economist. \"That's a really strong pattern we see from all the research.\"\n\n\nThe Invisible Institute",

        "Keeping older people at work can also boost wages for younger employees, argues Ros Altmann, the government-appointed champion for older workers. Her report suggests two reforms that can keep older people in the work force, which include a \"comprehensive overhaul\" of the country's pension and social security systems. \"The main focus for young people needs to be on what is at its root a work-life issue: finding a job,\" Altmann said, referring to the long-term unemployed.\n\nShe and the government's chief economist, Udo Steffen, agree that one way to improve labour supply would be to relax labour-market rules, which are more onerous for the jobless than for the job-holding populace. But to ease the labour supply for companies, the government must also make sure that the economy remains competitive.\n\nOn this score, Germany is already in good shape. German companies are investing at a brisk pace, a sign of confidence in what is traditionally",
