        "Maj Richard Scott, 40, is accused of driving at speeds of up to 95mph (153km/h) in bad weather before the smash on a B-road in Wiltshire. Gareth Hicks, 24, suffered fatal injuries when the van he was asleep in was hit by Mr Scott's Audi A6. Maj Scott denies a charge of causing death by careless driving. Prosecutor Charles Gabb alleged the defendant, from Green Lane in Shepperton, Surrey, had crossed the carriageway of the 60mph-limit B390 in Shrewton near Amesbury. The weather was \"awful\" and there was strong wind and rain, he told jurors. He said Mr Scott's car was described as \"twitching\" and \"may have been aquaplaning\" before striking the first vehicle; a BMW driven by Craig Reed. Mr Scott's Audi then returned to his side of the road but crossed the carriageway again before colliding head-on with a Ford Transit van in which Mr Hicks was a passenger,",
        "The ban was backed by local authorities in Urumqi, state media reported. The move is the latest in a campaign against Islamic clothing and symbols in the mainly Muslim region. China's government has blamed Uighur militants for several recent attacks - but activists say the violence has been fuelled by Chinese repression. The Uighurs traditionally practice a moderate form of Islam. Recently, though, the influence of stricter forms of the faith from the Gulf and Pakistan has led to more women covering their faces. According to the BBC's Asia Pacific editor, Charles Scanlon, the Chinese authorities regard wearing an Islamic face veil as an act of defiance at a time of growing violence in the region. In August this year, the northern city of Karamay banned men with long beards from boarding buses. Some experts believe such restrictions could backfire at a",

Horses are only allowed to receive hay-feed or water before a race, but other substances such as electrolytes are permitted post-race. Employees of Palmer and fellow trainers, Francois Rohaut and and Jean-Claude Rouget, as well as the trainers themselves, were interviewed by stewards following a report by the Equine Welfare and Integrity Officer.

The report has also detailed a number of \"tests\" or benchmarks for the government's northern powerhouse scheme. Research by the IPPR showed only 47% of children born in the poorest families in the north of England achieved a good level of early years development compared with 59% in London.

Ports have refused to accept Hanjin cargoes without guarantees that port fees will be paid. However, creditors, banks and the South Korean government are all reluctant to put up the cash.

The spike is largely down to viewers turning on lights and boiling their kettles straight after the programme.

The Great British Bake Off, the Strictly Christmas special and Call the Midwife are also expected to create high demand over the Christmas period.

        "The jury found Irek Hamidullin guilty on 15 counts, including supporting terrorists and conspiracy to use a weapon of mass destruction. The 55-year-old is the first military prisoner from Afghanistan to be tried in a US federal court. Some of the charges carry a mandatory life sentence. About 30 insurgents died in the attack, with Hamidullin the only survivor, while no American or Afghan soldiers were killed. Hamidullin, who did not testify during the trial, is expected to be sentenced on 6 November. Lawyers say it is unusual for someone captured on the battlefield in Afghanistan to be transferred to the United States for trial in a federal court. Hamidullin's defence lawyers had tried unsuccessfully to have the charges dismissed, saying their client was a prisoner of war and ineligible for trial in civilian court.",

Claimed by India and Pakistan, it is dubbed the world's highest battlefield. Later, Mr Modi travelled to the Kashmir valley where floods killed at least 281 people and left Srinagar under water. More than a million people were displaced. Mr Modi is the second Indian PM to visit Siachen. Manmohan Singh went there in 2005. More soldiers have died from harsh weather on the glacier than in combat since India seized control of it in 1984, narrowly pipping Pakistan.

Mr Modi met senior officials and aid workers to review relief measures on the occasion of Diwali, the biggest Hindu festival.

Enterprise Minister Arlene Foster objected to his decision to act alone and she is seeking a judicial review. Mr Durkan described her upcoming court challenge as a \"waste\" of public money. BMAP identifies planning zones for retail, residential or commercial development and is set to affect almost 40% of the Northern Ireland population. It covers not just Belfast, but outlying areas such as Carrickfergus, Lisburn, Newtownabbey and north Down. Announcing her plans to seek a judicial review, Ms Foster accused Mr Durkan of failing to bring BMAP before his ministerial colleagues in the Northern Ireland Executive. \"Instead of bringing it back to the executive for discussion and approval, the DoE minister published it himself,\" she said. However, in a statement on Saturday, Mr Durkan said: \"It is simply not true that I",

He faces three charges, including attempting to murder the off-duty PSNI officer and causing an explosion likely to endanger life. He is also charged with membership of the IRA. The charges relate to an attack on a police officer in Castlederg on 12 May 2008. He was on his way to work in Fermanagh when a bomb exploded under his car at Spamount, near Castlederg. He suffered serious leg injuries and was rescued by a member of the public who dragged him from the wreckage shortly before it burst into flames.

Vets say the disease - which leads to kidney failure - is similar to \"Alabama Rot\", which was first seen in the US in the 1980s. The source of the disease is unknown. However, the Environment Agency has ruled out chemical contamination in water supplies. The majority of the dogs that died in the past year were in the New Forest, but there were also others in Surrey, Cornwall, Worcestershire and County Durham. The notices say owners should take their dog to a vet even if the lesions appear a week after a walk.

Schools districts nationwide remain conflicted on whether to require transgender students to use bathrooms corresponding with the sex listed on their birth certificates. The justices accepted a petition from Gloucester County, Virginia, ruling that the school board was not required to comply with a lower court's order that transgender student Gavin Grimm should be allowed to use the boys' bathroom. Gavin, a student who was born female but identifies as male, came out as a transgender boy during his freshman year of high school.
