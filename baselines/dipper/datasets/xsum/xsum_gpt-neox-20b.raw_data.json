Gareth Hicks, 24, suffered fatal injuries when the van he was asleep in was hit by Mr Scott's Audi A6. Maj Scott denies a charge of causing death by careless driving. Prosecutor Charles Gabb alleged the defendant, from Green Lane in Shepperton, Surrey, had crossed the carriageway of the 60mph-limit B390 in Shrewton near Amesbury. The weather was \"awful\" and there was strong wind and rain, he told jurors. He said Mr Scott's car was described as \"twitching\" and \"may have been aquaplaning\" before striking the first vehicle; a BMW driven by Craig Reed. Mr Scott's Audi then returned to his side of the road but crossed",
        "The ban was backed by local authorities in Urumqi, state media reported. The move is the latest in a campaign against Islamic clothing and symbols in the mainly Muslim region. China's government has blamed Uighur militants for several recent attacks - but activists say the violence has been fuelled by Chinese repression. The Uighurs traditionally practice a moderate form of Islam. Recently, though, the influence of stricter forms of the faith from the Gulf and Pakistan has led to more women covering their faces. According to the BBC's Asia Pacific editor, Charles Scanlon, the Chinese authorities regard wearing an Islamic face veil as an act of defiance at a time of growing violence in the region. In August this year, the northern city of Karamay banned men with long beards from boarding buses. Some experts believe such restrictions could backfire at a time when many Uighurs believe their",

It said O negative blood made up 12% of transfers, although only 7% of people in the UK had that blood type. Meanwhile, B negative blood is needed for ethnic groups. The NHSBT said ethnic minority groups, who were more likely to have B negative blood, were more prone to sickle cell anaemia, where misshapen blood cells could block blood vessels, causing an early death. It also said such groups were more at risk of developing thalassemia, a group of inherited blood disorders that hindered the blood's ability to carry oxygen. Only 2% of Britain's population were B negative, but hospitals had used 6% more of this blood type in the past last four weeks than the same period last year, said the NHSBT.",

But on the Friday before the deadline, the government lodged an application to delay release until after the general election on 8 June. They argued that publication would fall foul of election \"purdah\" rules.

Young people in Indonesia, amused by the local buses' customised horns, have been waiting by the side of the road for vehicles to pass, encouraging bus drivers to toot their horn when they did so. Videos depicting this craze have gone viral in Indonesia. Some held signs to better attract the attention of the driver - signs which said 'Om Telolet Om'.

Stanford, the second Welsh woman to secure her Rio place after sailor Hannah Mills, finished 29 seconds behind, with Holland a further 15 seconds adrift.

More than 600,000 Jews live in about 140 settlements built since Israel's 1967 occupation of the West Bank and East Jerusalem. The settlements are considered illegal under international law, although Israel disputes this.

In March, a series of independent reports by academic Prof Dylan Jones-Evans, commissioned by Mrs Hart, recommended a development bank be created to make it easier for businesses to borrow money. He said it could be a \"catalyst and driving force\" to support small businesses and also help growth in the Welsh economy.

Her report suggests that extending working lives would add \u00c2\u00a355bn a year to the UK economy. If everyone worked one year longer, it would add 1% to annual GDP, she says. \"Academic and historical evidence shows that, far from damaging job prospects, keeping more older people in work is associated with rising employment and wages for younger people,\" said Dr Altmann, a former adviser to 10 Downing Street. If older people keep working, the theory goes, they have more money to spend, and that boosts the economy, creating more jobs for everyone. Conversely, if older people stop work, there is less money in the economy, so fewer jobs. The idea is well-known to economists as the \"lump of labour fallacy\" - the",

No. 91 Squadron arrived during 1941, flying Hurricanes; soon after, the Squadron moved to RAF Northolt",

        "The University of Calgary transferred 20,000 Canadian dollars-worth of bitcoins ($15,780; \u00c2\u00a310,840) after it was unable to withdraw cash from an ATM.\n\nA professor of computer science at the university, Jonathan Koomey, alerted the institution to the problem via email after his wife tried unsuccessfully to withdraw money from a Calgarians ATM.\n\nThe bank was able to confirm the professor\u2019s identity and account details and transferred the money to him, he said.\n\n\u201cI am relieved we have been given this solution, but my wife is irked the bank can\u2019t find a Canadian answer to the problem,\u201d Prof Koomey told the BBC.\n\n\u201cI am happy not to have been scammed \u2013 but a little miffed the bank couldn\u2019t think of a Canadian solution.\u201d\n\nIt is not the first time a Bitcoin ATM has been involved in a theft.

        "The film was shot on land leased for grouse shooting in the Derbyshire Peak District in February. Conservation group Raptor Persecution, who have been campaigning against grouse shooting for the past 18 months, claimed they witnessed men throwing sticks and stones with the intention of chasing down the birds.\n\nOne activist said he witnessed a female capercaillie \"trying to fend off a gang of men trying to attack it\" shortly after it emerged from its roost. The men, he claimed, were shouting \"let's get her\" and \"go on, run\" in an aggressive attempt to force the birds into the nets.\n\nThe RSPB warned that the film shows the \"grisly reality\" of culling, as well as \"the unnecessary killing of birds being held purely for sport\".\n\n\"Shooting in large numbers of birds \u2013 up to 30 capercaillie in a day \u2013 is cruel, both to the birds",
        "On average, they have received increases of 7.2% over the past year, according to the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (Rics).\n\nThe main reason behind this rise in prices, as previously mentioned, is the general shortage of housing stock that has been observed across the country. Many sellers were forced by the lack of properties on the market to accept higher offers.\n\nHowever, many other parts of the UK have suffered from a slowdown in the number of sales due to a reduction in the number of mortgage approvals for many buyers across the country. The slowdown came about at the end of 2016 and early in 2017 after the UK introduced new rules that mean buyers applying for a mortgage have to provide lenders with information about their salary. The new requirements have made it more difficult for some buyers to get mortgages, leading to a slowdown in the number of sales.\n\nThis led to the Rics\u2019 asking its members whether they had recorded lower levels of confidence",

        "Snaith School, an academy, is closed to its Year 7, 8 and 9 pupils after the group began arriving on Saturday. In a letter to parents the chairman of governors, Paul McIntyre, said: \u201cWe are now in the midst of a national crisis, at least in Wales, with the Covid-19 pandemic spreading rapidly.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cThe wellbeing and safety of all of our students and staff is our top priority. Our ability to implement social distancing [an important part of safeguarding] inside a school with our current student numbers, at this stage in the pandemic requires this temporary step.\u201d\n\nSnaith students, who are taught under a multi-academy trust, have two weeks of Easter holiday which had been booked before the school closed.

        "The skeleton belongs to a small, plant-eating dinosaur which lived 200 million years ago - at the beginning of the Jurassic Period. Although it isn't one of the most impressive-looking of all time, it was a remarkable dinosaur for its time because it was one of the first animals to develop a highly efficient way of breathing air - it had a very small brain, but it could swallow food as big as itself and breathe it in.

I can think of lots of animals from the past that I have seen in nature documentaries that I would love to see, or bones of which I have seen in museums. It means I can begin to understand the animal's environment, and the conditions in which it lived, and also its behaviour and social structure - how it fed, what it ate, and"
