Scott, a serving army major, appeared in court on Tuesday, charged with two counts of causing death by dangerous driving and three counts of causing serious injury by dangerous driving. He was granted bail and is due to appear in court again in May.

Fewer than one in 10 took more than their two weeks statutory leave. The research by the Institute of Leadership & Management (ILM) blamed \"ingrained\" attitudes among employers, and concerns among new fathers that they could not afford to take leave. Last year the government announced plans to allow parents to share their maternity and paternity leave - changes are scheduled to come in April 2015. But the ILM said its research suggested the changes would have little impact if attitudes of employers were not addressed as well. \"The introduction of shared parental leave is a crucial step towards enabling more women to progress into senior roles,\" said Charles Elvin, ILM chief executive. \"Yet our research revealed cultural barriers are impeding the uptake of both two weeks statutory paternity leave and additional paternity leave.\" He said there remained a \"cultural expectation\" within organisations that women rather than men will be the ones taking extended periods away from the workplace.

Responding", "GPT": "A survey of employees and managers found that a quarter of new fathers took no paternity leave at all. Fewer than one in ten new mothers took no maternity leave. The survey, conducted by a leading HR firm, sheds light on the persistent gender disparities in the workforce, even as companies strive to create more inclusive and family-friendly policies. The findings suggest that while companies may offer paternity leave, many new fathers are reluctant to take it, often due to cultural and societal pressures to be the primary breadwinner. This can perpetuate gender stereotypes and limit opportunities for women in the workplace. The survey also found that among those who did take paternity leave, the average length of leave was just over two weeks. This is significantly shorter than the amount of time new mothers typically take off, and may not be enough for fathers to fully bond with their newborns or support their partners during the postpartum period. To address these issues, experts suggest that companies should do more to normalize and encourage paternity leave, including providing education and resources to new fathers and addressing any underlying cultural or societal barriers that may be preventing them from taking time"}, {"human": "As with last year's parade, only the Orangemen and their 13 notified bands can march past St Patrick's Church on Donegall Street in north Belfast.

The report also revealed that candidate availability continued to decline in April, with the rate of reduction accelerating since March. This decrease in candidate supply, coupled with the robust demand for staff, led to further increases in starting salaries for people taking up new permanent roles. The rate of salary inflation was the fastest since August 2018. However, the report highlighted some concerns regarding the ongoing skills shortages in certain sectors, such as IT and finance.

The Iraqi government has faced criticism for its heavy-handed response to the protests, with human rights groups calling for an independent investigation into the use of excessive force. The protests are a reflection of the deep-seated frustration and anger felt by many Iraqis towards the government. Despite the country's vast oil wealth, many Iraqis continue to live in poverty and struggle to access basic services such as electricity and clean water. The Iraqi government must take immediate steps to address the legitimate concerns of the protesters and work towards creating a more transparent and accountable system of governance. The use of force to suppress peaceful protests is not only unacceptable but also counterproductive, as it only serves to further inflame tensions and undermine the"}, {"human": "Muslim cleric Mehboob Akhtar, of Stoke-on-Trent, was sentenced along with nine others including his wife and daughter.

Individuals with SMS often have delayed speech and language development, low muscle tone, and distinctive facial features. They may also exhibit challenging behaviors, such as self-injury, aggression, and sleep disturbances.

Alexis Sanchez's future at the Emirates has been the subject of much speculation in recent months, with the player yet to agree to an extension. Sanchez has been a key player for Arsenal since his move from Barcelona in 2014, scoring 72 goals in 140 appearances in all competitions. His performances this season, in particular, have been instrumental in keeping Arsenal in the hunt for a top-four finish in the Premier League. However, with no new contract in sight, there are fears that Sanchez could leave the club for free next summer, when his current deal expires. Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger has insisted that the club will do everything in its power to keep Sanchez, but the player's representatives are reportedly holding out for a significant increase in wages. The situation is further complicated by interest from other clubs, with Manchester City and Chelsea both rumored to be monitoring Sanchez's situation. Arsenal will be desperate to keep hold of their star player, but they may face a tough battle to convince him to stay.

However, the financial benefits of the event were not as significant as initially projected. The report revealed that while the event did bring in additional revenue, it fell short of the projected figures due to unforeseen costs and lower than expected ticket sales. Despite the financial shortcomings, the city council is optimistic about the potential of hosting similar events in the future. The report highlights the positive impact that the yacht racing had on the city's image and the increase in visitor numbers as evidence of the event's success. The council believes that with better planning and cost management, future events could generate even greater financial rewards for the city. The report also recommends that the city should continue to invest in promoting itself as a destination for major sporting events. By doing so, the council hopes to attract more visitors, create jobs, and stimulate economic growth.
