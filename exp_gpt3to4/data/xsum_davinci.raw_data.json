Gareth Hicks, 24, suffered fatal injuries when the van he was asleep in was hit by Mr Scott's Audi A6. Maj Scott denies a charge of causing death by careless driving. Prosecutor Charles Gabb alleged the defendant, from Green Lane in Shepperton, Surrey, had crossed the carriageway of the 60mph-limit B390 in Shrewton near Amesbury.

        "The ban was backed by local authorities in Urumqi, state media reported. The move is the latest in a campaign against Islamic clothing and symbols in the mainly Muslim region. China's government has blamed Uighur militants for several recent attacks - but activists say the violence has been fuelled by Chinese repression. The Uighurs traditionally practice a moderate form of Islam. Recently, though, the influence of stricter forms of the faith from the Gulf and Pakistan has led to more women covering their faces. According to the BBC's Asia Pacific editor, Charles Scanlon, the Chinese authorities regard wearing an Islamic face veil as an act of defiance at a time of growing violence in the region. In August this year, the northern city of Karamay banned men with long beards from boarding buses. Some experts believe such restrictions could backfire at a time when many Uighurs believe their culture is under attack.

The report has also detailed a number of \"tests\" or benchmarks for the government's northern powerhouse scheme. Research by the IPPR showed only 47% of children born in the poorest families in the north of England achieved a good level of early years development compared with 59% in London. Its survey also found five northern city-regions combined had almost as many well-qualified individuals (3.6 million) as London (3.7 million) - but the IPPR forecasts demand for skilled workers in the North is set to increase.

The three-day event was launched by tourist body Welcome to Yorkshire after the county hosted the Tour de France Grand Depart in 2014. More than 1.2m people lined the 320-mile (515km) route. Mr Parnaby said last year's event had attracted thousands of spectators to the East Riding. \"The council feels that the investment made by the authority, circa \u00a3100,000, to bring part of the race here is money well spent and will provide opportunities for local traders to capitalise on increased spending and help boost the East Riding economy,\" he said.

Mr Hunt wants to change junior doctors' contracts, which he says are \"unfair\". The BMA said its door was open to talks and blamed the strikes on Mr Hunt's \"shambolic mishandling\" of the matter. The dispute, which began in 2014 and centres around pay and weekend working, has led to strikes being held across England. The next is a 24-hour strike planned for Wednesday, when emergency care will only be provided from 08:00 GMT. Asking by Marr about low morale among junior doctors, Mr Hunt said: \"One of the reasons for that anger is that they were told by the BMA that their pay was going to be cut - it isn't. \"They were told that they were going to be asked to work longer hours - they aren't,\" he added. \"We are actually bringing down the hours that they work.

It insists no stations will close and no firefighters will be forced to leave their jobs. The Brigade said it had continued to meet London-wide attendance time targets while the 13 engines had been out of service. It said that bringing them back would improve response times by about four seconds for the first engine to reach the scene.

Speaking at an event in Berlin, he urged Germany to use its G20 presidency in 2017 to make progress. Mr Carney has previously warned of climate change risks for the finance industry. At the event on Thursday, Mr Carney said that in theory capital should flow from advanced to emerging economies due to high returns. In practice, however, the opposite has happened - and this has driven down bond yields in advanced economies, he said. When money has sporadically flowed to emerging economies it has had a destabilising influence, he said. \"In this context, green finance is a major opportunity. By ensuring that capital flows finance long-term projects in countries where growth is most carbon intensive, financial stability can be promoted,\" he said. Mr Carney said the issuance of green bonds - for example, to help finance water or renewable power projects aimed at reducing carbon emissions - could double in 2016 from last year's $42bn. But they still represent only 1% of holdings by global financial institutions, he said. \"The development of this",

The NHSBT said ethnic minority groups, who were more likely to have B negative blood, were more prone to sickle cell anaemia, where misshapen blood cells could block blood vessels, causing an early death. It also said such groups were more at risk of developing thalassemia, a group of inherited blood disorders that hindered the blood's ability to carry oxygen.

Julie Bailey, who set up the campaign group Cure the NHS after witnessing her mother's treatment, was made a CBE. Helene Donnelly, a nurse who became a whistleblower, was made an OBE. Figures suggested there were more deaths than would have been expected at Stafford Hospital between 2005 and 2008. Patients needing pain relief either got it late or not at all, leaving them crying out for help, and there were cases where food and drinks were left out of reach. Helene Donnelly worked in the A&E department at the hospital. She raised nearly 100 complaints about the treatment of patients, turned whistleblower and was a key witness at the Stafford Hospital public inquiry. She told the BBC she was \"tremendously proud and honoured\" to receive the OBE for services to the NHS, after what had been a \"very difficult time personally and professionally\".

Ports have refused to accept Hanjin cargoes without guarantees that port fees will be paid. However, creditors, banks and the South Korean government are all reluctant to put up the cash.

Dominic Scott, head of the UK Council for International Student Affairs, said it would be a \"nail in the coffin\" for recruiting overseas students. The Home Office has argued there are no limits on numbers of genuine students.

Opponents insist the unlisted building is historically significant and an influx of elderly residents would put pressure on services in the village.

        "The Sakurajima volcano on Japan's Kyushu island poses a \"growing threat\", researchers at the University of Bristol say. The volcano erupted at 05:57 GMT on Sunday spewing smoke, gas and rocks into the air, Japanese officials said. Sakurajima, on the western coast of the southern Japanese island, has been erupting since early April. Scientists say the growing activity of the volcano is because of the eruption of an underground magma chamber. Sakurajima has been experiencing volcanic activity on and off for decades. It has not had a large eruption since October 2007 when a similar event to that on Sunday happened. The February eruption forced more than 250 people living near the volcano to flee their homes, but no injuries or deaths were reported. In April, Sakurajima was hit by dozens of smaller quakes. Sakurajima is more than 4,900m (16,000 feet) high. It is part of the larger Sakurajima volcano group, which also includes Mount Kuchidake. Nearby towns and villages have been covered in volcanic ash from previous eruptions.",

Personal details of around 9,000 account holders, including some phone numbers and addresses, were stolen in the data breach, Tesco has said.\n\nThe data that may have been compromised, which came from a small percentage of Tesco Bank's overall customer base, is thought to include names, some bank sort codes and phone numbers, and the date of birth for some customers. This is in line with the data held by Tesco Bank about current account holders, but does not include data from credit cards or account history. No PIN numbers are thought to have been accessed in the data breach.\n\nThe data breach occurred when a criminal gang were able to penetrate Tesco's security systems.

They also discovered more than 300 rounds of live ammunition, another gun, air rifles, and knives.\n\nPolice experts carried out a series of tests on the weapons.

Froome has won all three stages so far and sits comfortably atop the general classification standings.\n\n\"I would love to ride the Tour, and I think my legs are good enough,\" Thomas told the Telegraph. \"I've always said I think my style of riding could do well in the Tour.

Three unnamed police forces in England and Wales are using technology to identify such factors by cross-referencing criminal records against historical data. However, such data is patchy, with too few recorded offences, which means its ability to predict future offending is limited.\n\nSir David also flagged up the need for new police recruits to have a broader skills base.
