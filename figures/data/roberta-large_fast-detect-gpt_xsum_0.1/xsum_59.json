This launch was the country's first successful attempt at putting a satellite into orbit using its own rocket.\n\nThe KSLV-1, also known as Naro, was developed jointly by the Korea Aerospace Research Institute (KARI) and the Russian space agency, Roscosmos. Previous attempts in 2009 and 2010 were unsuccessful due to technical issues.\n\nThe successful launch of the KSLV-1 is a significant achievement for South Korea, as it now joins a select group of nations capable of independently launching satellites into space.
