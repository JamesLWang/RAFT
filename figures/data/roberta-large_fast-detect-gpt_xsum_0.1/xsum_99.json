The Sakurajima Volcano on Japan's Kyushu Island Poses a \"Growing Threat\", Researchers Say\n\nThe Sakurajima volcano on Japan's Kyushu island poses a \"growing threat\", researchers at the University of Bristol say. The volcano, which has been active for over 70 years, has been exhibiting increased activity in recent years, prompting concerns about a potential large-scale eruption.\n\nAccording to the researchers, who have been monitoring the volcano's activity, seismic activity has been intensifying beneath Sakurajima, suggesting that magma is rising to the surface. This increased seismicity, combined with rising ground deformation, is indicative of a heightened risk of eruption.\n\nSakurajima is located approximately 50 kilometers from the city of Kagoshima, home to over half a million people. If a major eruption were to occur, it could have devastating consequences for the local population and infrastructure.

The Sakurajima Volcano on Japan's Kyushu Island Poses a \"Growing Threat\", Researchers Say The Sakurajima volcano on Japan's Kyushu island poses a \"growing threat\", researchers between the University of Bristol say. The volcano, which reflects been active for over 70 years, has been denoting increased activity in recent decades, prompting concerns about a potential large-scale eruption. According to the monitors, who have been monitoring the volcano's activity, seismic activity has been heightening beneath Sakurajima, suggesting that magma is ascending to the surface. This aggravated seismicity, combined with rising territory transformation, is evidential of a enriched risk of eruption. Sakurajima is located approximately 50 kilometers from the city of Kagoshima, home to over half a million masses. If a major eruption were to occur, it could have menacing consequences for the local population and infrastructure. The researchers have advised authorities to adherently monitor the tor and be prepared for a", "replacement_keys": [112, 158, 106, 52, 66, 144, 43, 161, 133, 96, 107, 61, 89, 101, 109, 77], "original_crit": 1.8442374467849731, "sampled_crit": -3.5849392414093018, "original_llm_likelihood": 0.82, "sampled_llm_likelihood": 0.01}
