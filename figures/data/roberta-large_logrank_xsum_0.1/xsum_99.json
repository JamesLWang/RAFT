The Sakurajima Volcano on Japan's Kyushu Island Poses a \"Growing Threat\", Researchers Say\n\nThe Sakurajima volcano on Japan's Kyushu island poses a \"growing threat\", researchers at the University of Bristol say. The volcano, which has been active for over 70 years, has been exhibiting increased activity in recent years, prompting concerns about a potential large-scale eruption.\n\nAccording to the researchers, who have been monitoring the volcano's activity, seismic activity has been intensifying beneath Sakurajima, suggesting that magma is rising to the surface. This increased seismicity, combined with rising ground deformation, is indicative of a heightened risk of eruption.\n\nSakurajima is located approximately 50 kilometers from the city of Kagoshima, home to over half a million people. If a major eruption were to occur, it could have devastating consequences for the local population and infrastructure.

The Sakurajima Volcano on Japan's Kyushu Island Poses a \"Growing Threat\", specialists Say The Sakurajima volcano on Japan's Kyushu island poses a \"growing threat\", researchers amid the University of Bristol say. The volcano, which has been active for over 70 years, has been exposing aggrandized activity in recent junctures, prompting concerns about a potential large-scale eruption. According to the researchers, who have been monitoring the volcano's conduct, seismic activity has been intensifying beneath Sakurajima, suggesting that magma is emerging to the surface. This increased seismicity, combined with rising ground adjustment, is important of a deepened risk of eruption. Sakurajima is located approximately 50 kilometers from the city of Kagoshima, home to over half a million people. If a major eruption were to occur, it could have damaging consequences for the local civilization and setup. The researchers have advised directors to heedfully monitor the volcano and be prepared for a", "replacement_keys": [112, 62, 158, 156, 66, 144, 12, 84, 43, 96, 107, 61, 149, 109, 151, 29], "original_crit": -0.7401636242866516, "sampled_crit": -1.3323900699615479, "original_llm_likelihood": 0.98, "sampled_llm_likelihood": 0.35}
