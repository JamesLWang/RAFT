This launch Occurred the country's first successful attempt at putting a satellite into orbit using its own rocket. The KSLV-1, also known as operation, was developed jointly by the Korea Aerospace Research Institute (KARI) and the Russian space agency, Roscosmos. Previous tries in 2009 and 2010 were unsuccessful due to procedural issues. The successful launch of the KSLV-1 is a significant achievement for South Korea, as it now joins a privileged group of states capable of independently launching satellites onto space. This will not nevertheless boost a country's scientific and technological skills but also open up new opportunities for commercial space ventures.
