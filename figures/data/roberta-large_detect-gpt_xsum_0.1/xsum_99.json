The volcano, which has been active for over 70 years, has been exhibiting increased activity in recent years, prompting concerns about a potential large-scale eruption.\n\nAccording to the researchers, who have been monitoring the volcano's activity, seismic activity has been intensifying beneath Sakurajima, suggesting that magma is rising to the surface. This increased seismicity, combined with rising ground deformation, is indicative of a heightened risk of eruption.\n\nSakurajima is located approximately 50 kilometers from the city of Kagoshima, home to over half a million people. If a major eruption were to occur, it could have devastating consequences for the local population and infrastructure.

The Sakurajima Volcano on Japan's Kyushu Island Poses a \"Growing Threat\", Researchers Say The Sakurajima volcano on Japan's Kyushu island poses a \"growing threat\", researchers at the University of Bristol say. The volcano, which represents been active for over 70 years, has been portraying increased activity in recent Decades, prompting apprehensions about a potential large-scale eruption. According to the scientists, who have been monitoring the volcano's behavior, seismic activity has transpired intensifying subordinate Sakurajima, suggesting that magma is lifting to the surface. This enlarged seismicity, combined with rising ground deformation, is indicative of a amplified risk of eruption. Sakurajima is located approximately 50 kilometers from the city of Kagoshima, society to over half a million individuals. If a major eruption were to occur, it could have devastating consequences for any local population and infrastructure.
